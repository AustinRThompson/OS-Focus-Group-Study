So, as it turns out, I wasn't able to. // And so then I went to the person who manages the faculty websites, and said, hey, I want to do this thing. It's this movement within the field to be more transparent, open. And she said. Oh, well, a lot of faculty end up forgetting to update their manuscript list, so we just don't allow them to be posted at all. So like well, you know. So that was just one example of trying to put in the work and then meeting resistance due to all of these layers, and figuring. Well, you know. This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement. // The university has a special format of how they want you to have your profile set up on the University website. So there's limitations to perhaps what can be posted there. // The other element of this is that I am at a university that is a regional campus of a flagship state school. And so there's department, college, university here and then there is what we jokingly refer to as the mothership downstate. And then there's all of their rules. And so I just need to understand, like for me, facilitating this process would be. I need to figure out what is my hierarchy? Who do I talk to? How do I get this all figured out?  Which could be a me problem and it's not something that everyone else deals with. But...it's...there's just a lot out there. Of like layers.",1.18577075098814
"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",B-I,B-I,R1,6,"Well, the only barrier is what what what the University's policy is. // My universities and R1, I think many of us here at our R1 or similar. And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones. But most of the publishers want the money within like 2 weeks of acceptance, and that is just not gonna to happen with getting funds from the university that fast. So the idea is nice, but the whole, like how it pans out is not so great. // But, there's so many people interested in it that the waitlist is very long, and we it's been like 8 months now, and I still haven't been contacted for that. // I would say IT support to get everything up on our University affiliated website. So making sure like, because I can't post directly to my my like University website. It has to go through our IT team. So that's sometimes super efficient. And other times really not. // I don't have access to my website. It's run by the PR at the university. And it's just, you know, six extra emails for me to get the paper up there. Per paper.  // The lack of control of the university run website is a big barrier. I am able to put links on mine but I have to go through our department administrator, who isn't very tech, savvy.

"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",B-I,B-IRB,R1,3,"And I mean particularly for what I do using speech samples is always a challenge with IRB and how you know, sharing that data. And but I think it's so important. And how how do we do that, and how you navigate the IRB to make that happen. I think are big challenges that I'm interested in learning more about. // The good point too I guess, this goes back to barriers. But having had the experiences we've had with IRB and data sharing, it does feel very daunting to to try to get something like this through when you've had such hard and challenges with it in the past. Right? so I don't know. Sorry. That's not really. There's no facilitator in there, but I think it's a good point. // Yeah, it's definitely a moving target with IRBs. We've we've had some issues with that for sure. So we're working on it. But it's it's a hard one. // Ours has been the IRB just changing what it interprets as shareable versus not like having we didn't used to have to get explicit yesâ€™s to X's point earlier of sharing Xyz. Now it's explicit yes, which is what it should be. But they've just changed, you know, having to require that. // The moving target nature of the IRB also plays a role and and in the specifically with with what level of data you want to share. So we haven't run into any issues sharing like derived acoustic measures, and data of that form. But I'd love to be able to share speech samples actual, you know, audio recordings?

"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",B-I,B-IRB,non-R1,2,"Additionally, you know, my IRB, sometimes I I perceive them as kind of like worrying about things excessively. So if I were to share data openly, I'm worried that the IRB would shut that down at my university, or I would face backlash from them. // My IRB is not willing to let me put anything online like I've I've asked their permission to put things on on like the childes database website, and they refuse.",0.790513833992095
"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",B-NE,B-NE,non-R1,4,"but because my university is not a research focused university, I don't think open access for research is as much of a concern. Especially because our tenure and promotion expectations are going to be lower because we're not a research focused institution. // none of them are pressing, and I don't know about anybody else, but I really respond well to deadlines and pressure, and so this never has a deadline or pressure, so it's never at the top of my list. // because right now I feel like I'm I lack the motivation to do right preregistration, because it's not something that is, looked for, say, in my promotion or tenure reviews, and it's not valued by my university. // I don't perceive a lot of benefit to myself, and that sounds selfish because it is, but I have to watch out for my own time. And so yeah, I just don't see a lot of external motivation, // But yeah, just lack of external motivation or incentives. // I work at a teaching school. Open access fees...The gold open access fees cost more than I'm allotted for research each year. I don't care that much about impact factors. I just want my words on paper.

And so then it became more of like a niche for me, and no one used it, and so I haven't used it for a while. But I need to get back to it as I am starting to do a lot on my own. // Yeah, this is fresh in my mind, because I'm like deep in doing this right now, but like the tenure process doesn't care, they literally don't care. And so there's no incentive there whatsoever like never have I been asked about it, Like I make a specific section about it that I've been told to cut by multiple people which I'm not going to do. But it's not incentivized terribly well. And I think many of us, you know, it's like we're not. That's not the end goal is to know, you know, do this to receive tenure. But it's it's very not helping. When you're, you know, trying to choose what to spend your time on. // And I think, to X's point previously about this, like stigma kind of with some of the journals anyways. And I'm not even totally sure if that's true or not right? So like education about actually, you know what it means. And if it's a bad thing, right? Then how do committees look at like tenure committees look at that? Things like that. // So it does also have this sinking cost in in your, in your tenure track",1.58102766798419

"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",F-E,F-E,R1,3,"I think that the other thing, though, is it's not really people in our positions, in tenure track jobs, we don't get credit anywhere in like the tenure process for using open science practices, well versus not using them. And it is extra time and effort to do. So, I think you know one other thing is like if this was valued by institutions more, if this was something where you got, I don't know it's recognized in some way, or it was prioritized by institutions, that that would also, I think, motivate people to do this more. // I think it's like a culture issue. So, if it were the culture of the department in which you're working where this is just something that is standard practice. Then it might, I might be more likely to devote the time and energy to do it rather than trying to, you know. Find it within, you know, as a as working in a silo in just my research lab with my students and my research assistants. // Yeah, I will say, though, my, my college just changed our tenure guidelines, and we do have a a new part in there that talks about, you know. Please mention if you were practicing open science because we think you know, as a college, we would like to move towards open science practices.

You know I do think it's going to encourage our institutions to kind of step up to the plate a little bit in, you know, helping to facilitate open data. // Well, I think the NIH is changing to require data sharing, so I think that'll be a good facilitator. Anyone who has funding will be forced to. // I know some NIH institutes have repositories and have it very clearly spelled out, while other institutes leave you to your own devices to do it",1.18577075098814
"1.1 - Expectations, policies, regulations",F-NIH,F-NIH,R1,2,"I think one thing that could be a facilitator, or at least forcing people to do. Is like, I said, the NIH grants have requirements, updated requirements now for, like a very detailed plan about how you are gonna share your data. So, thinking through that ahead of time, like forcing you to think you through that ahead of time and come up with plan that you document and put in with grant applications, I would think, would likely be a facilitator. // so sometimes I just put collaboratorsâ€™ NIH grants in my acknowledgments so that they'll yell at me so that I can put it on PubMed central.",0.790513833992095
1.10 - Knowledge,B-KOP,B-KJP,non-R1,6,"I agree with that. I would also say that the self-archiving piece always kind of makes me worry that someone mentioned previously about which version you're going to put out there, and I'm always really nervous unless I have an open access paper that I paid for. I know I can put that anywhere, but if it's not open access like which version can I put up individual independently, because I don't want to like have to go to court because I did something wrong. I'm probably catastrophizing it, but that for me. // and you know, as a pre- tenure assistant professor, I'm also very conscious of making sure that that I have data to publish, and making sure that I'm not just looking negative in any way to potential publishers. And unfortunately, that's just the reality of it. // And I would love to hear that from a publisher standpoint. I would love to hear from. You know someone who who does work for a peer-reviewed publication to say, this is okay, this is not.

If you know, if it's not really clear in the journal if that's okay, then that's the biggest barrier for me. // It kind of came up earlier, but just keeping track of what versions are allowed for which journal.  // I don't make it publicly available just because I don't want. I don't know if journals are on Research Gate looking for academics to sue or whatever. But I don't want to find out.

So that's kind of where Iâ€™m at. // And like figuring out the different things for different journals. // Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier. // The barrier for me is the legality as we talked about before, and you know, what are you allowed to do when you're not allowed to do?

But like for myself, that's something I think will be something I need to consider seriously when Iâ€™m thinking about which journal to submit to // which is a huge barrier for those of us who are all early in our career, because it's like, don't know how much I have laying around. That's, you know, $12,000 for 4 papers. So that's the other fun experience I've had. // My universities and R1, I think many of us here at our R1 or similar. And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones. But most of the publishers want the money within like 2 weeks of acceptance, and that is just not gonna to happen with getting funds from the university that fast. So the idea is nice, but the whole, like how it pans out is not so great. // Certainly the cost. I think that's the obvious answer, but especially the cost for junior investigators who might not have big you know, externally funded grants as we're building our program of research. And so some of the some of the smaller internal and external grants that are awarded early in your career just simply don't have the the budget to support that line item. // I guess all of these sound interesting, but the a lot of people have mentioned the financial burden of open access, so the gold open access. // I agree, and they're also vastly different by journal. The amount of money that it is. I know somebody who recently had an article accepted to nature neuroscience, and their open access fee is $13,000. And so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much...They didn't pay it. // There are some smaller society journals. It's kind of a balance between like a less impactful journal that's open access and a more impact for a journal that's gonna cost $3,000 plus the open access fee which I don't have and don't want to pay. But you know it's like Neurobiology of Language isnâ€™t indexed in PubMed and so then what are you even publishing there for? But it is free for people to access. // I think we all have a problem with we're doing all this work, and it goes to other publishers, and it's not ours. And we don't get compensated for being authors or being reviewers. That's like a side thing I think we all struggle with. But then adding what X was saying, that weâ€™re gonna pay for it seems like it shouldn't come on us. // Well, it's not really been an option for me, because my startup is running out, so I don't even have this money so, but I have thought about it, and wondered should I do it?",3.55731225296443

So if there's three authors on my paper, my library is only going to pay for the one-third for me, and then the other 2 thirds, even even if I'm first author, then the other 2 thirds need to be covered by someone else.

And like figuring out the different things for different journals. So it's really just been sort of a time limitation that's kind of prevented me from following through on doing that at this point, even though I'd like to. // But I I do feel like there's a big learning curve and time commitment associated with figuring it all out. // Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier. // I know that we tried to publish like, trying to put something and register some...a couple of manuscripts, but it didn't happen because it was taking away time from the actual manuscript // But also make it less time and effortful, effortless?  // So for example, I I I know the mechanics behind getting you know a paper up before it's formatted by the journal for post prints or pre prints, and I know the mechanics of putting my code up on OSF and making it available. But I feel like all of that takes a lot of additional time for me. Making sure that even if it's not the final formatted version of a paper, it's still in a format that I feel really confident is very, very, very close to what's gonna finally get published. // I think the time element resonates for me. But in the stage of preparing whatever I have to make freely available. So, for example, some journals require that you submit the figures as separate attachments, and so then they appear at the end of the manuscript. As a reader I really don't like reading things that way. So I do want to take the time to put the figures and the captions and the tables in where they would be. But again, that feels like this extra set of steps. And then there's other, you know, versions of that same sort of dilemma of how much modification to make to something, just to make it freely available. Not just to make it freely available. That's very important. But if I'm just trying to get it closer and closer to what the final published version looks like it...Right? It it's again this sort of time-effort trade off. // I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower. // That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment. // I'll just echo that time has been a factor. // But mostly it's time // And I guess so I guess time is a little bit, because the time that it takes to look into all of that, and then trust that I understood it right.
