And so, when I wanted to share some of those methods, they were still under copyright from their from their published work, they they had given them to me so that I could use them. But I couldn't share them sort of openly and publicly. So that was a barrier that I've experienced. // One quick one. Copyright of stimuli. So, I use stimuli that I'm really interested in natural speech perception. And so, we actually use some movie clip stimuli that are copyrighted. I think, under fair use it's fine to use them, but I can't share.

It just seems like there's multiple steps, // But it's so many steps, and like clicking and digging through everything // And then sharing data is a little more complicated, I would say, from my perspective. // And every time I look into, you know, dig into the requirements for the journal, and I pull up the page, and I use the site that you can search for requirements. And still, it's really confusing to me. // And so I just need to understand, like for me, facilitating this process would be. I need to figure out what is my hierarchy? Who do I talk to? How do I get this all figured out?  Which could be a me problem and it's not something that everyone else deals with. But...it's...there's just a lot out there. Of like layers. // This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement. // And then, like my dissertation data, I have it in my IRB that I can do it. But you know, life got in the way, and it just didn't happen, because it is something new, and it takes more effort. And I had to finish over that // I actually think that that this is starting to be a discussion, though I'm sorry. But I actually think this accessibility might be be useful as a barrier. So only people who are really dedicated will will work on it. It’s accessible to everyone. But it's not  that that just everyone can just pick it up and do something with it. // But also make it less time and effortful, effortless?  // It need to be carefully done, and it requires technical skills,  //  the paperwork it takes to get access. And to upload data was very lengthy, at least for me as a user just as a user I I didn't even upload my own data. I wanted to get access to a shareable data on the website. It took forever, just to get all the paperwork done so.  // I mean, I'm sure we'll get into some of this, but so overwhelming to think about where to start with these things right? // And for code I haven't figured out how to do that efficiently, because my code is always a slew of comments to myself that I don't necessarily want on...accessible to everyone. More just because it's very informal to me. And so there always feels like there needs to be a cleaning step which just feels unnecessary, but also necessary. // It's a really good point, yeah, about making...or how to make your practices efficient and work for because it does just feel, I mean, at least at this point for me feels like this extra big step that is like, how do I even do this with everything else going on? // We struggled with the actual process of putting the the protocol up on OSF. We found it really confusing about what kind of project or document we were putting up and ended up with two different projects, I guess. Then one of them you could change one of them you couldn’t, and when you can find XX and one you can't. And so it was really hard navigating Open Science Framework by ourselves, even with the help of our librarian. So that's been a big challenge for us. // And so it does feel like this big thing to add on to the beginning, or wherever in your project // I think the time element resonates for me. But in the stage of preparing whatever I have<P>to make freely available. So, for example, some journals require that you submit the figures as separate attachments, and so then they appear at the end of the manuscript. As a reader I really don't like reading things that way. So I do want to take the time to put the figures and the captions and the tables in where they would be. But again, that feels like this extra set of steps. And then there's other, you know, versions of that same sort of dilemma of how much modification to make to something, just to make it freely available. Not just to make it freely available. That's very important. But if I'm just trying to get it closer and closer to what the final published version looks like it...Right? It it's again this sort of time-effort trade off. // And then, if you're like, I collaborate with tons of universities. So then you have to set up a data sharing agreement which goes through legal, which takes three months to do and so you've just got some locality attached to it, too, and it slows everything down, and or you just don't pursue it."

What we did is, we would kind of come up with our analysis plans, you know, as we're going along. // It's just this is so antithetical to how we've been doing research forever. I think that's what I feel like is the big barrier, you know. // Like, I'm in a department where literally everyone has been here for over 20 years, and none of them are doing open science because they don't. They don't need it. They they don't perceive that it's important."

But then it's also trying to make sure that everybody understands the... I guess the the experiment itself, and the purpose of it, because I feel like that's always dangerous when you're sharing data. They may say, oh, there's a limitation in this data but it's like, well, that wasn't a focus. The focus was here. So I think there's just making sure interpretation of the data is done properly. And so how can I do that? // You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata."

But I don't want to find out.  // I just don't wanna get sued for sharing my own work that I that I worked on it's a little bit ridiculous that we're not allowed to share our own work.  // and you know, as a pre- tenure assistant professor, I'm also very conscious of making sure that that I have data to publish, and making sure that I'm not just looking negative in any way to potential publishers. And unfortunately, that's just the reality of it. // Because that's kind of been my limiting factor, and just again making sure I I do it right, and I kind of protect myself pre tenure. // I agree with that. I would also say that the self-archiving piece always kind of makes me worry that someone mentioned previously about which version you're going to put out there, and I'm always really nervous unless I have an open access paper that I paid for. I know I can put that anywhere, but if it's not open access like which version can I put up individual independently, because I don't want to like have to go to court because I did something wrong. I'm probably catastrophizing it, but that for me. // Additionally, you know, my IRB, sometimes I I perceive them as kind of like worrying about things excessively. So if I were to share data openly, I'm worried that the IRB would shut that down at my university, or I would face backlash from them. // It's kind of the vulnerability of posting your ideas before you've done this study. // The good point too I guess, this goes back to barriers. But having had the experiences we've had with IRB and data sharing, it does feel very daunting to to try to get something like this through when you've had such hard and challenges with it in the past. Right? so I don't know. Sorry. That's not really. There's no facilitator in there, but I think it's a good point."

And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then // So for me, I guess it's one of the things is like how to format the data, and also format the protocol in a kind of accessible way to others. I know like different labs do different things. So how to format in a way that everyone can understand. I think that's..sounds like takes a little bit of effort. It's really like when we writing code. Sometimes we understand our code, but not necessarily others understand our code. So, there's something, maybe, to learn about how to make more accessible. // I was talking about just like how to format it. // I think the amount ofalso related to formatting as well. // And for code I haven't figured out how to do that efficiently, because my code is always a slew of comments to myself that I don't necessarily want on...accessible to everyone. More just because it's very informal to me. And so there always feels like there needs to be a cleaning step which just feels unnecessary, but also necessary. //  I think that it was X who said this before about like having to clean up your data, your<P>protocol or code, or whatever it is that you have created for yourself. Yeah, lots of internal notes that makes sense to me, but would look really ridiculous if I put them out for everyone to see. So just knowing, like a a kind of general good format for these things."

So, as it turns out, I wasn't able to. // The university has a special format of how they want you to have your profile set up on the University website. So there's limitations to perhaps what can be posted there. // The other element of this is that I am at a university that is a regional campus of a flagship state school. And so there's department, college, university here and then there is what we jokingly refer to as the mothership downstate. And then there's all of their rules. And so I just need to understand, like for me, facilitating this process would be. I need to figure out what is my hierarchy? Who do I talk to? How do I get this all figured out?  Which could be a me problem and it's not something that everyone else deals with. But...it's...there's just a lot out there. Of like layers. // And so then I went to the person who manages the faculty websites, and said, hey, I want to do this thing. It's this movement within the field to be more transparent, open. And she said. Oh, well, a lot of faculty end up forgetting to update their manuscript list, so we just don't allow them to be posted at all. So like well, you know. So that was just one example of trying to put in the work and then meeting resistance due to all of these layers, and figuring. Well, you know. This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement. // I would say IT support to get everything up on our University affiliated website. So making sure like, because I can't post directly to my my like University website. It has to go through our IT team. So that's sometimes super efficient. And other times really not. // Well, the only barrier is what what what the University's policy is. // But, there's so many people interested in it that the waitlist is very long, and we it's been like 8 months now, and I still haven't been contacted for that. // I don't have access to my website. It's run by the PR at the university. And it's just, you know, six extra emails for me to get the paper up there. Per paper.  // The lack of control of the university run website is a big barrier. I am able to put links on mine but I have to go through our department administrator, who isn't very tech, savvy. And so that is a huge barrier for me. // My universities and R1, I think many of us here at our R1 or similar. And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones. But most of the publishers want the money within like 2 weeks of acceptance, and that is just not gonna to happen with getting funds from the university that fast.

As far as I can tell. // I tried to write funds for open access, publishing into my startup, and I was denied so. But I guess that would be a barrier, but it would have helped.  // Open access fees...The gold open access fees cost more than I'm allotted for research each year.  // For me, You know. I'm curious about like how to kind of manage the cost of publishing open access. Because typically, just to publish doesn't cost anything but making it open access adds a cost. So, I don't know if my university would be willing to cover that. // I think the biggest barrier is, where do you find the funds to be able to pay for open access? I think that's the biggest in smaller departments like ours. // I would add that that the funding is a huge issue. Specifically, when you're not in an R rated institution right? Because we don't have research assistance. We don't have lab space. We don't have let alone, just flat out cash to pay for an open access readership. // That's what I was gonna share is just the cost associated with it. My university university doesn't have a lot of funding. I have no experience with grant writing, so I don't even really know how to access funding for opportunities like this. // But you know I I am at an institution that it's an R2, specifically, and the vibe here has always been uou pay for it yourself. // I know my library also has that, but the money is distributed equally between authors. So if there's three authors on my paper, my library is only going to pay for the one-third for me, and then the other 2 thirds, even even if I'm first author, then the other 2 thirds need to be covered by someone else. So that makes it a little bit difficult at my institution. //  maybe this is just me being idealistic, but you know we already don't get any financial kickback from publishing, and so I feel like the cost associated with publishing open access is pretty inequitable. We, I mean, at my university unfortunately, like we are, we we don't get paid like a very high salary and trying to bridge that research to practice gap through open access, then basically punishing us by making us pay for something when we already don't get any monetary gain from publishing it. Personally, it makes no sense to me, so I don't see like, if the idea is open access, then why do we have to pay still for open access? That seems like it doesn't accomplish the spirit of open access science. // To me, there's like 2 parts: the first is publish in open access journals. So that's something, I think, as a very junior PI that's kind of a financial burdens a lot. So because, like where my PI has a lot of money. So I don't need to worry about that. But like for myself, that's something I think will be something I need to consider seriously when I’m thinking about which journal to submit to // I guess all of these sound interesting, but the a lot of people have mentioned the financial burden of open access, so the gold open access. // Certainly the cost. I think that's the obvious answer, but especially the cost for junior investigators who might not have big you know, externally funded grants as we're building our program of research. And so some of the some of the smaller internal and external grants that are awarded early in your career just simply don't have the the budget to support that line item. // I agree, and they're also vastly different by journal. The amount of money that it is. I know somebody who recently had an article accepted to nature neuroscience, and their open access fee is $13,000. And so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much...They didn't pay it. // It’s just you have to figure in the amount of money beforehand. // which is a huge barrier for those of us who are all early in our career, because it's like, don't know how much I have laying around. That's, you know, $12,000 for 4 papers. So that's the other fun experience I've had. // The fee. // Yeah, for sure. The money. When you're in a lab that has a ton of funding, great let's do it. And when you are almost out of your startup funds, and you’re a new faculty like this is not the top priority for where that funding goes. // There are some smaller society journals. It's kind of a balance between like a less impactful journal that's open access and a more impact for a journal that's gonna cost $3,000 plus the open access fee which I don't have and don't want to pay. But you know it's like Neurobiology of Language isn’t indexed in PubMed and so then what are you even publishing there for?

And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones.

And so, when I wanted to share some of those methods, they were still under copyright from their from their published work, they they had given them to me so that I could use them. But I couldn't share them sort of openly and publicly. So that was a barrier that I've experienced. // My IRB is not willing to let me put anything online like I've I've asked their permission to put things on on like the childes database website, and they refuse. // Somebody earlier mentioned participant consent. Which I think, as as I grow as a researcher and my awareness of open science practices, grows. I'm starting to build that into consent processes. But you know, for studies that have already been done like you can't retroactively do it, so that I think just getting participant consent, and having the mechanisms in place to do it can be potentially a barrier // Sometimes I work with pretty specialized patient populations, and when the study has a low n it would make me really nervous to share like lesion data and like it would. It would be that almost to the point where you could potentially figure out who they are, if you know where the study was conducted, and kind of some of the specifics of their disease, so I that would make that makes me nervous, especially with the low n. // I do a lot of mixed methods work, and especially in the qualitative portion. I'm worried about that as well. I'm worried that you know the more my participants share, the harder it's going to be to completely de-identify them, and I don't want my participants to have to worry about you know, the what they share in the interview. I don't want them to have to be concerned about like over-sharing or giving me too much information. // I was trying to decide how to frame it as a facilitator but I just I don't know if there is a way to like. So our IRB here thinks that audio recordings, and I don't know how true this is for other places, but those are identifiable, especially with the low n like X was saying // I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do, like if there's if if it was someone's job to do it, that would be...And making sure it's de-identified, and you know, like the stress was making sure everything's de-identified, taking the time to do that on top of everything else we have to do is faculty, I think. I mean, I think time is a big barrier too with anything that's not required it. It gets pushed and pushed and pushed with everything else that you have to do kind of prioritized. // And as part of my postdoc, like I had, I was the one who had to format the data for that thing. And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then. But I would. That is a barrier to me right now. I like would never want to do that again, because you know it, it was just who's going to do that? It took so much time. So yeah, time is a huge one // And then sharing data is a little more complicated, I would say, from my perspective. // Because I really do feel often that I am fighting a fight without the support of the librarians that that would be so beneficial to me. Which person do I need to talk to? To talk about the open data processes within my institution. Which person do I need to talk to? For. Yeah. You get the idea. // Additionally, you know, my IRB, sometimes I I perceive them as kind of like worrying about things excessively. So if I were to share data openly, I'm worried that the IRB would shut that down at my university, or I would face backlash from them. // I don't perceive a lot of benefit to myself, and that sounds selfish because it is, but I have to watch out for my own time. And so yeah, I just don't see a lot of external motivation, and it’s opening up myself up to potential criticism. Not that I think that there's anything wrong with my stimuli. But yeah, just lack of external motivation or incentives. // I think also in terms of protocols or more of like my R syntax, or something like that, is taking the time to clean it up. Rather than like the shorthand that it's currently in to be able to make it readable by someone else, just taking the time to to clean it up and make it public facing // As as supportive as our library is our ITS is maybe not so much so. We don't have access to some of the the programs like. Of course, now I can't think of it. We have Qualtrics, but we don't have what's it called? Red Cap. Thank you. Because they have some concerns about you know, anyways. So that's been the the bane of my existence recently, but just having access to some of those database programs as well. // And then, like my dissertation data, I have it in my IRB that I can do it. But you know, life got in the way, and it just didn't happen, because it is something new, and it takes more effort. And I had to finish over that // But for some of the platforms, they don't give you that amount of storage limit. Which is kind of a limit for some of them. So that's something I can...as I'm learning the process. I feel like I'm still trying to figure out which would be a good platform kind of, for sharing the data // But I I do feel like there's a big learning curve and time commitment associated with figuring it all out. // We have multi-modal data, including for example, video, audiom speech sample, that can be identifiable. They're They're just lot of issues that we need to deal with before uploading and the deidentifying to the best we can for data sharing. // I think one of the barriers is is the value of the data set. I always feel that there is more in it than this. Just this one publication. So I'm, for for those reasons I'm reluctant to sharing, because I always think like there's like two more publications in this data set. So why would I give that away? // So for me, I guess it's one of the things is like how to format the data, and also format the protocol in a kind of accessible way to others. I know like different labs do different things. So how to format in a way that everyone can understand. I think that's..sounds like takes a little bit of effort. It's really like when we writing code. Sometimes we understand our code, but not necessarily others understand our code. So, there's something, maybe, to learn about how to make more accessible. // I actually think that that this is starting to be a discussion, though I'm sorry. But I actually think this accessibility might be be useful as a barrier. So only people who are really dedicated will will work on it. It’s accessible to everyone. But it's not  that that just everyone can just pick it up and do something with it. //  I was talking about just like how to format it. But then, also you know, I use R and then I can get like a print out of what all the codes mean and everything. But then it's also trying to make sure that everybody understands the... I guess the the experiment itself, and the purpose of it, because I feel like that's always dangerous when you're sharing data. They may say, oh, there's a limitation in this data but it's like, well, that wasn't a focus. The focus was here. So I think there's just making sure interpretation of the data is done properly. And so how can I do that? But also make it less time and effortful, effortless? I guess you could say. While doing all of that, so<P>make sense in my brain, but it might not make sense in theirs.  // That's the the description of your whole experimental design takes time. You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata. That's you. You spend time to create and clarify. So I I I think the amount ofalso related to formatting as well. The the amount of work that you put into this need also to be supported by resources. It's time, and it. It need to be carefully done, and it requires technical skills, and also the the website I posted on chats, the data brewery video database. It... the paperwork it takes to get access. And to upload data was very lengthy, at least for me as a user just as a user I I didn't even upload my own data. I wanted to get access to a shareable data on the website. It took forever, just to get all the paperwork done so. These are all barriers, and will prevent people from contributing to this society. // One quick one. Copyright of stimuli. So, I use stimuli that I'm really interested in natural speech perception. And so, we actually use some movie clip stimuli that are copyrighted. I think, under fair use it's fine to use them, but I can't share. I'm pretty sure that I can't share the stimuli online, but that would be super important for anybody who wants to use the raw data instead of just derived data that I've created. So, I'm not. I'm honestly not sure what I should do about that. // Yeah, it's definitely a moving target with IRBs. We've we've had some issues with that for sure. So we're working on it. But it's it's a hard one. // And I mean particularly for what I do using speech samples is always a challenge with IRB and how you know, sharing that data. And but I think it's so important. And how how do we do that, and how you navigate the IRB to make that happen. I think are big challenges that I'm interested in learning more about. //  I think that it was X who said this before about like having to clean up your data, your<P>protocol or code, or whatever it is that you have created for yourself. Yeah, lots of internal notes that makes sense to me, but would look really ridiculous if I put them out for everyone to see. So just knowing, like a a kind of general good format for these things. // Ours has been the IRB just changing what it interprets as shareable versus not like having we didn't used to have to get explicit yes’s to X's point earlier of sharing Xyz. Now it's explicit yes, which is what it should be. But they've just changed, you know, having to require that. // And then, if you're like, I collaborate with tons of universities. So then you have to set up a data sharing agreement which goes through legal, which takes three months to do and so you've just got some locality attached to it, too, and it slows everything down, and or you just don't pursue it. // The moving target nature of the IRB also plays a role and and in the specifically with with what level of data you want to share. So we haven't run into any issues sharing like derived acoustic measures, and data of that form. But I'd love to be able to share speech samples actual, you know, audio recordings? And in some institutions, one of my previous institutions that that itself is considered personally identifiable data, just the audio recordings of speech. And that's not the case everywhere but even at institutions where it's not the case, I think making sure to incorporate that and make it really transparent to participants for example, that that's one of the goals is is just...There's just a lot of issues wrapped up in how to do that ethically from both an open science practice and working with with individuals who you're asking to participate in these ways. // I don't know, like we had trouble even getting our IRBs through for people with aphasia, because who can consent if you have a language disorder, and so then the like if I had that much trouble, just getting a basic behavioral study through, will I also never get an IRB be approved for people with aphasia to consent to have their data open. So that this is yeah been the main problem, and especially for speech production stuff like // The good point too I guess, this goes back to barriers. But having had the experiences we've had with IRB and data sharing, it does feel very daunting to to try to get something like this through when you've had such hard and challenges with it in the past.

They don't need it. They they don't perceive that it's important. // And so it feels like, even if I were to like intrinsically be motivated to do it, there would be barriers, because I don't have the support of the senior people around me. // Yeah, this is fresh in my mind, because I'm like deep in doing this right now, but like the tenure process doesn't care, they literally don't care. And so there's no incentive there whatsoever like never have I been asked about it, Like I make a specific section about it that I've been told to cut by multiple people which I'm not going to do. But it's not incentivized terribly well. And I think many of us, you know, it's like we're not. That's not the end goal is to know, you know, do this to receive tenure.

And concern that my methods and analysis plan will need to shift between preregistration and publication. // For me it's time. I'm I have a pretty large teaching load, and it's for me sometimes it's like it's one more thing, and if I put something out there, someone I so right now I teach a 3-3 in the fall, because I just got tenured. I will now teach a 4-4, and when I put something out there a a big lab could could do that. Would I what's gonna take me as somebody with a big teaching load with a 4-4 is gonna take me over a year. Somebody's got a lot of resources. It's gonna take them a couple of months, and for me sometimes it's just it's that was my idea, and not that I'm i'm scared of being beings scooped, or whatever. But it's the fact that I don't have as much time and resources, being someone with a high teaching load at a very teaching focused university. So that's that's part of it is the the time factor, and that that concern to be honest. // I also teach a 4-4, or I do teach a 4-4, and I feel like I have enough time. I have a really tough time carving out time for research as it is. So adding an additional step to the research processes like I said, it's going to make it less likely that things get done, and I'm having enough of a tough time getting things done, as it is. Also, sorry I didn't mean to cut somebody off. I just<P>maybe I just have imposter syndrome or something, but I also don't feel very confident in develop...I obviously I have a PhD. Like, I know how to sort of develop research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. But I I again feel very anxious putting it out there for everybody else, especially like before I'm finished with it, because I feel like I might have missed something, or it just gives me a little bit of anxiety because I still don't feel super confident. // I defended my dissertation a year ago. For me research is still a learning process, and without being the most recent big research that I did. My methods changed mid-dissertation. My analysis plan changed mid-dissertation. I know that's poor quality, because, you know, obviously I should have all of that outlined ahead of time, and I should be held accountable to following those, you know, procedures. But I just still feel like, hey, I'm a lousy researcher. My plan A probably isn't going to work out. You know. How do I shift away from something if it's preregistered and written in stone? // What everyone saying is making me realize that I think the biggest barriers is that we just aren't used to doing it. We don't know what we're doing, and we haven't been trained to do this this isn't how we've been taught to do research our entire, like. I think I'm kind of maybe on on the older end like I finished my, I started my PhD in 2006. I won't say when I finished it, but because it was a long time. But you know this wasn't how we did research. What we did is, we would kind of come up with our analysis plans, you know, as we're going along. And and you know which is yeah, maybe that's not what we're supposed to do, but that's kind of how I was trained to do it, you know, and it was like, oh, let's do a post. We even called a post hoc. It's like, oh, this correlation looks interesting. Let's see right? So there's something kind of scary about coming up with an analysis plan and sticking to it ahead of time. And like I said, I'm doing this for the first time right now. And it is it's interesting how I'm working with these two people, and I have one person who is not comfortable sticking to what we said we are going to do, and this is a very famous person in our field who is very well established. But this is just like not what we've been, how we've been trained, you guys, and so it's not that we're bad researchers, or you know that are stuff is not important enough. I was thinking about what you're talking about with time time, X, cause theoretically, this saves us time right, because, like you, you know, like you come up with what you're going to do, and you know. // It's just this is so antithetical to how we've been doing research forever. I think that's what I feel like is the big barrier, you know. // : Yeah I mean, it goes back to what someone is saying about like you're not sure what you're gonna do with the stats like. You might make some statistical decision, and it's not the right one.  // I do a lot of qualitative work, and, like your research questions can change once you have started analysis, so I feel like the rules become even less clear, and that makes it harder to preregister qualitative studies // So I I'll I'll. My contribution is really short. It's just honestly my own organizational practices are the biggest barrier for me preregistering. // It's kind of the vulnerability of posting your ideas before you've done this study. // But I agree with the previous comment that just getting yourself organized and put together like even writing the preregistration can take weeks to get yourself set up and ready to go // If there's any changes from your preregistration, and you're writing it in your manuscript, you tend to have to take the space to then explain that the differences between what you preregistered and what actually happened. So, depending on word count and things like that that could potentially be a barrier. // because right now I feel like I'm I lack the motivation to do right preregistration, because it's not something that is, looked for, say, in my promotion or tenure reviews, and it's not valued by my university. // But having to duplicate that work. You know, I don't have time for that, as some of you've already said, // I know that we tried to publish like, trying to put something and register some...a couple of manuscripts, but it didn't happen because it was taking away time from the actual manuscript // I guess. To me, I mean this isn't a direct answer to this question, but I'm not really sure what the benefits are of preregistering my study. So I think I I need to have a better understanding of why it's beneficial to do that before putting the time into figuring out how to do that. // I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower. You know a lot of us have students, but it takes a while to get them trained. And this seems like something that would require some training from the PI if a student was going to assist with it. But yeah, I I I would. I would agree with X that if you don't necessarily see the benefit, then why why, invest the time in doing this. That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment. // Our biggest barrier, is to X's point time, when to do that, and when to submit it // but it's mostly just the time aspect of getting it in. // We struggled with the actual process of putting the the protocol up on OSF. We found it really confusing about what kind of project or document we were putting up and ended up with two different projects, I guess. Then one of them you could change one of them you couldn’t, and when you can find XX and one you can't. And so it was really hard navigating Open Science Framework by ourselves, even with the help of our librarian. So that's been a big challenge for us. // I'll just echo that time has been a factor. And then, I think, like some sort of amorphous concern that putting it out there. And I I think this is probably something that's not grounded in any sort of reality. But like that, putting it out there will give somebody else the idea to then run away with my project. That isn't really the main barrier. It's just kind of like this back of my mind kind of thought. But mostly it's time, confusion about how to do it, what details I need to have, how much detail to go into, those kinds of things. And some of it, too, that's been, probably there's probably real easy to find answers for this. But, like the analysis plan, do I need to have<P>alternative analyses if, like, my data don't need the assumptions for the first proposed analysis, like how much detail. // For me it kind of feels like more of a change in mindset that needs to happen. I think of like, why this is important, and that I should spend the time on it. Because if I'm being totally honest that, you know, because I wasn't trained, none of us were trying to do this. And so it does feel like this big thing to add on to the beginning, or wherever in your project // I also, I guess I kind of have this concern. It's like a cooks in the kitchen concern. Because you never know if the reviewers that you get for your pre registration are going to be the same review as you get for your grant. And so then, when you need to go, submit your, resubmit your grant, you've now had to modify, based on two different sets of reviewer feedback. // It's not clear that right now that the time that is required to do all this stuff actually helps us at this stage."

We don't have let alone, just flat out cash to pay for an open access readership. // But you know I I am at an institution that it's an R2, specifically, and the vibe here has always been uou pay for it yourself. // I know my library also has that, but the money is distributed equally between authors. So if there's three authors on my paper, my library is only going to pay for the one-third for me, and then the other 2 thirds, even even if I'm first author, then the other 2 thirds need to be covered by someone else. So that makes it a little bit difficult at my institution. // As as supportive as our library is our ITS is maybe not so much so. We don't have access to some of the the programs like. Of course, now I can't think of it. We have Qualtrics, but we don't have what's it called? Red Cap. Thank you. Because they have some concerns about you know, anyways.

If you know, if it's not really clear in the journal if that's okay, then that's the biggest barrier for me. // 4: I agree. I'm. I'm nervous about it. So, for example, on Research Gate, I I will if someone messages me asking for a copy, I always send it to them, but I don't make it publicly available just because I don't want. I don't know if journals are on Research Gate looking for academics to sue or whatever. But I don't want to find out. So that I think just the fact that each journal has very specific requirements makes me nervous. So I think I'm comfortable sharing the the Pub Med, you know version, if that's available, for if it was an NIH funded study, but otherwise I I am a little...makes me nervous. // 8: I do a lot of work as second author and third author, and that kind of thing. So I you know I need to get consent from the other authors. At least I feel like. But then often I'm depending on them to send me the accepted manuscript. And either they don't get around to it, or don't feel like it, or they're not on board, so that's been a barrier that I've encountered. // We don't have a really robust lab website. I don't have a personal website, so it just seems like there's multiple steps that even if I got something published which I don't have many publications. So that's part one is the issue that again, the time to have manuscripts that I can publish and self- archive. But then the process of like creating the the website or the repository, or wherever it's going to be. It just seems like there's multiple steps, and none of them are pressing, and I don't know about anybody else, but I really respond well to deadlines and pressure, and so this never has a deadline or pressure, so it's never at the top of my list. // No, just I I don't know what I'm allowed to do, and I like...every journal has different rules, so it's not even like I can just say like, oh, I'm allowed to do X. Because ASHA has a different rule compared to you know, Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, and I just. I just don't wanna get sued for sharing my own work that I that I worked on it's a little bit ridiculous that we're not allowed to share our own work. // I tried to put up free, legal versions of previous manuscripts on my department website, but was told that I had to adhere to a particular format that didn't allow for publications to be posted on there. So, as it turns out, I wasn't able to. // Because that's kind of been my limiting factor, and just again making sure I I do it right, and I kind of protect myself pre tenure. // And I would love to hear that from a publisher standpoint. I would love to hear from. You know someone who who does work for a peer-reviewed publication to say, this is okay, this is not. Because that's kind of been my limiting factor, and just again making sure I I do it right, and I kind of protect myself pre tenure. // I agree with that. I would also say that the self-archiving piece always kind of makes me worry that someone mentioned previously about which version you're going to put out there, and I'm always really nervous unless I have an open access paper that I paid for. I know I can put that anywhere, but if it's not open access like which version can I put up individual independently, because I don't want to like have to go to court because I did something wrong. I'm probably catastrophizing it, but that for me. // It kind of came up earlier, but just keeping track of what versions are allowed for which journal. And every time I look into, you know, dig into the requirements for the journal, and I pull up the page, and I use the site that you can search for requirements. And still, it's really confusing to me. // I think this also came up earlier, but just having the time also to make a personal website. Some like, I think it was X who mentioned that that there's some, you know, formats. The university has a special format of how they want you to have your profile set up on the University website. So there's limitations to perhaps what can be posted there.<P>So yeah, I I did make myself a personal website, and it does take a lot of time and work, and<P>kind of wonder if it's really, you know, worth it. But that's that's my main area. // The other element of this is that I am at a university that is a regional campus of a flagship state school. And so there's department, college, university here and then there is what we jokingly refer to as the mothership downstate. And then there's all of their rules. And so I just need to understand, like for me, facilitating this process would be. I need to figure out what is my hierarchy? Who do I talk to? How do I get this all figured out?  Which could be a me problem and it's not something that everyone else deals with. But...it's...there's just a lot out there. Of like layers. // Yeah, to kinda to follow up to that comment. In I think my first year of my faculty position I was really motivated to self-archive, and have, you know, really accessible on my website a list of all of my manuscripts that are available. And so, I had a grad student take some time, and you know, figure out the requirements to the best of her knowledge, and tell me which copies of things. And so then I went to the person who manages the faculty websites, and said, hey, I want to do this thing. It's this movement within the field to be more transparent, open. And she said. Oh, well, a lot of faculty end up forgetting to update their manuscript list, so we just don't allow them to be posted at all. So like well, you know. So that was just one example of trying to put in the work and then meeting resistance due to all of these layers, and figuring. Well, you know. This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement. // It's just been something that's been pushed to the bottom of the To Do List for kind of a long time, because it's really time consuming to go through all of those old papers and figure out, where is that final version of the accepted manuscript? And like figuring out the different things for different journals. So it's really just been sort of a time limitation that's kind of prevented me from following through on doing that at this point, even though I'd like to. // Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier. // I would say IT support to get everything up on our University affiliated website. So making sure like, because I can't post directly to my my like University website. It has to go through our IT team. So that's sometimes super efficient. And other times really not. // For me, understanding what are the things that I need to legally look out for, and just kind of making sure that it's all good before I do it. So that's kind of where I’m at. // Well, the only barrier is what what what the University's policy is. // But, there's so many people interested in it that the waitlist is very long, and we it's been like 8 months now, and I still haven't been contacted for that. // Yeah, I agree also even after the CSDisseminate talk about self archiving, we still, in the in my lab, are struggling to find the rules for each publisher, and it seems like every time we look they are a little bit different. So that's been a really big challenge. // So for example, I I I know the mechanics behind getting you know a paper up<P>before it's formatted by the journal for post prints or pre prints, and I know the mechanics of putting my code up on OSF and making it available. But I feel like all of that takes a lot of additional time for me. Making sure that even if it's not the final formatted version of a paper, it's still in a format that I feel really confident is very, very, very close to what's gonna finally get published. // I don't have access to my website. It's run by the PR at the university. And it's just, you know, six extra emails for me to get the paper up there. Per paper.  // And so then I get confused about like, well, where can I put these that they will be findable through the one avenue I've given people to find my work. // The lack of control of the university run website is a big barrier. I am able to put links on mine but I have to go through our department administrator, who isn't very tech, savvy. And so that is a huge barrier for me. // The barrier for me is the legality as we talked about before, and you know, what are you allowed to do when you're not allowed to do? That's really the barrier for me. And I guess so I guess time is a little bit, because the time that it takes to look into all of that, and then trust that I understood it right. I guess that I guess that part is maybe a time barrier. But really it's it's more about not having the knowledge of what we can and kind of can't do, and where. // I think the time element resonates for me. But in the stage of preparing whatever I have<P>to make freely available. So, for example, some journals require that you submit the figures as separate attachments, and so then they appear at the end of the manuscript. As a reader I really don't like reading things that way. So I do want to take the time to put the figures and the captions and the tables in where they would be. But again, that feels like this extra set of steps. And then there's other, you know, versions of that same sort of dilemma of how much modification to make to something, just to make it freely available. Not just to make it freely available. That's very important. But if I'm just trying to get it closer and closer to what the final published version looks like it...Right? It it's again this sort of time-effort trade off. // I do think that that's a barrier is<P>being nervous about doing it wrong."

So adding an additional step to the research processes like I said, it's going to make it less likely that things get done, and I'm having enough of a tough time getting things done, as it is.  // So that's part one is the issue that again, the time to have manuscripts that I can publish and self- archive. // I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do // taking the time to do that on top of everything else we have to do is faculty, I think. I mean, I think time is a big barrier too with anything that's not required it. It gets pushed and pushed and pushed with everything else that you have to do kind of prioritized. // And as part of my postdoc, like I had, I was the one who had to format the data for that thing. And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then. But I would. That is a barrier to me right now. I like would never want to do that again, because you know it, it was just who's going to do that? It took so much time. So yeah, time is a huge one // But I agree with the previous comment that just getting yourself organized and put together like even writing the preregistration can take weeks to get yourself set up and ready to go // But having to duplicate that work. You know, I don't have time for that, as some of you've already said, // I think this also came up earlier, but just having the time also to make a personal website. // So yeah, I I did make myself a personal website, and it does take a lot of time and work, and<P>kind of wonder if it's really, you know, worth it. // I think also in terms of protocols or more of like my R syntax, or something like that, is taking the time to clean it up. Rather than like the shorthand that it's currently in to be able to make it readable by someone else, just taking the time to to clean it up and make it public facing // I know that we tried to publish like, trying to put something and register some...a couple of manuscripts, but it didn't happen because it was taking away time from the actual manuscript // It's just been something that's been pushed to the bottom of the To Do List for kind of a long time, because it's really time consuming to go through all of those old papers and figure out, where is that final version of the accepted manuscript? And like figuring out the different things for different journals. So it's really just been sort of a time limitation that's kind of prevented me from following through on doing that at this point, even though I'd like to. // But I I do feel like there's a big learning curve and time commitment associated with figuring it all out. // And so I've been finding that in order to learn more, it requires a lot of self study, and then, of course, finding the time and the bandwidth to move that item up on the priority list is always so challenging, although I really value it so it's it's been a bit of a struggle personally. // So as the need like...I would love to say I would attend a webinar. But the honest truth is, I likely don't have the time to figure out how to make that work. // I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower. // That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment. // Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier. // But also make it less time and effortful, effortless?  // That's the the description of your whole experimental design takes time. // You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata. That's you. You spend time to create and clarify.  // The the amount of work that you put into this need also to be supported by resources. It's time, and it. //  the paperwork it takes to get access. And to upload data was very lengthy, at least for me as a user just as a user I I didn't even upload my own data. I wanted to get access to a shareable data on the website. It took forever, just to get all the paperwork done so.  // it requires a lot of time investment to to get the process right. // So for example, I I I know the mechanics behind getting you know a paper up<P>before it's formatted by the journal for post prints or pre prints, and I know the mechanics of putting my code up on OSF and making it available. But I feel like all of that takes a lot of additional time for me. Making sure that even if it's not the final formatted version of a paper, it's still in a format that I feel really confident is very, very, very close to what's gonna finally get published. // Our biggest barrier, is to X's point time // but it's mostly just the time aspect of getting it in. // I'll just echo that time has been a factor. // But mostly it's time // It's not clear that right now that the time that is required to do all this stuff actually helps us at this stage. // And I guess so I guess time is a little bit, because the time that it takes to look into all of that, and then trust that I understood it right. I guess that I guess that part is maybe a time barrier. // I think the time element resonates for me. But in the stage of preparing whatever I have<P>to make freely available. So, for example, some journals require that you submit the figures as separate attachments, and so then they appear at the end of the manuscript. As a reader I really don't like reading things that way. So I do want to take the time to put the figures and the captions and the tables in where they would be. But again, that feels like this extra set of steps. And then there's other, you know, versions of that same sort of dilemma of how much modification to make to something, just to make it freely available. Not just to make it freely available. That's very important. But if I'm just trying to get it closer and closer to what the final published version looks like it...Right? It it's again this sort of time-effort trade off. // My universities and R1, I think many of us here at our R1 or similar. And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones. But most of the publishers want the money within like 2 weeks of acceptance, and that is just not gonna to happen with getting funds from the university that fast. So the idea is nice, but the whole, like how it pans out is not so great. // And then, if you're like, I collaborate with tons of universities. So then you have to set up a data sharing agreement which goes through legal, which takes three months to do and so you've just got some locality attached to it, too, and it slows everything down, and or you just don't pursue it. // That's not the end goal is to know, you know, do this to receive tenure. But it's it's very not helping. When you're, you know, trying to choose what to spend your time on."

We, I mean, at my university unfortunately, like we are, we we don't get paid like a very high salary and trying to bridge that research to practice gap through open access, then basically punishing us by making us pay for something when we already don't get any monetary gain from publishing it. Personally, it makes no sense to me, so I don't see like, if the idea is open access, then why do we have to pay still for open access? That seems like it doesn't accomplish the spirit of open access science. // So just add to that, I would also say, I also think it kind of defeats the purpose of open access, and that it's supposed to be for everyone and make this, I would think, a more like transparent and diversified research environment where it, when it's paid for it, kind of limits who can participate in that. And what type of research is even getting published on it. // Certainly the cost. I think that's the obvious answer, but especially the cost for junior investigators who might not have big you know, externally funded grants as we're building our program of research. And so some of the some of the smaller internal and external grants that are awarded early in your career just simply don't have the the budget to support that line item. // which is a huge barrier for those of us who are all early in our career, because it's like, don't know how much I have laying around.

People looking at like a small n like X was saying, you know, and and being able to see that across studies, and seeing, oh, this is a consistent finding, especially like clinical finding. // Also, just to add that you know, in our field we tend to have fairly small N studies just because of accessibility of research participants. And so you know the more that we share things openly, particularly data in that sense, it's easier to combine results from different studies to to sort of answer, maybe different questions than we could answer individually in our little, you know, silos. // So many of the study, you see, is very small simple size. So I'm wondering if there is open data everywhere, so someone can put them together. Maybe create like a larger data, a database, so that I can maybe help answer some of the questions I can't answer. I think there's something there. Sometimes I will frustrated. I can only get like 10 people for my study, and everyone's doing such things.

And so then we're all able to kind of slide it under that, using their platform which is nice, especially for MRIs. De-identified MRIs. // Yeah, I I agree with that completely. Right now, we have the IRB approving for putting things open if we have consent from the participant for a neurotypical group of young adults. // ...numbers like a my eye tracking study where we have on OSF, it's just numbers. There's nothing identifiable. There was no question that we could put that up there. But with MRI or production, or EEG, or like anything that could, I mean, EEG not. But yeah."

I go to the CSDisseminate website to see, you know, like which journals let you post accepted copies and etc.  // I tried to put up free, legal versions of previous manuscripts on my department website, but was told that I had to adhere to a particular format that didn't allow for publications to be posted on there. So, as it turns out, I wasn't able to. // So yeah, I have published in open science journals and uploaded my papers on Bio archive for public accessibility. //  and then in terms of self archiving. So I've done preprints before, but I'm always sort of unclear about okay. Once that actually gets accepted and published. What do I do with the preprint? Do I leave it up? Do I update it? Do I take it down? I don't know. I could probably figure it out.

Hey? Have you gotten any articles submitted or published? Would you like to archive them? And all I had to do was send them the title and the the journal, and they did all the contacting and figured out which draft needed to be...it was wonderful. // In I think my first year of my faculty position I was really motivated to self-archive, and have, you know, really accessible on my website a list of all of my manuscripts that are available. And so, I had a grad student take some time, and you know, figure out the requirements to the best of her knowledge, and tell me which copies of things. And so then I went to the person who manages the faculty websites, and said, hey, I want to do this thing. It's this movement within the field to be more transparent, open. And she said. Oh, well, a lot of faculty end up forgetting to update their manuscript list, so we just don't allow them to be posted at all. So like well, you know. So that was just one example of trying to put in the work and then meeting resistance due to all of these layers, and figuring. Well, you know. This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement. // So, I have a preprint of my Thesis Masters. So that's that's something that I did early on without really even knowing what open science was. //  And spent some time kind of going through my publications and figuring that out. And then never quite got to the point of getting everything posted on my website. But...on my lab website.

The one thing I was gonna mention is, I've actually had a cease-and-desist letter from a publisher about the linking your own personal copy. So just per X's comment there, I'm not sure even that gets you away from that I've actually and of course it was Elsevier. I mean, you could also do that? But anyway, so typically, we just link to pre-prints and as far as I know, as long as you update the pre print to the accepted version, I've learned, it's okay. // I just link to my Google Scholar profile.
