"1","R1_1","F","F: Okay. let's go ahead and begin our first question. Open Science refers to a collection of research practices that aim to increase the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. What experiences have you had using open science practices? If any. And again you can just unmute and go ahead and jump in.",1
"2","R1_1","19","19: Hi all I'm. X, Can you hear me? Okay.",2
"3","R1_1","F","F: Yes.",3
"4","R1_1","19","19: Okay, great. I...I have such limited experience with open science, and I think one of the most relevant contributions to that question that I could make is that I had a PI once pay for open access to...for for our manuscript to be openly accessible post publication. So I know that that's possible. I know it's quite expensive, and I know that without funding from the institution under which the research was conducted and the PI's willingness to devote funding to that, we likely wouldn't have been able to take advantage of that option.",4
"5","R1_1","F","F: Thank you, X. Other experiences with open science practices?",5
"6","R1_1","20","20: Hi! Oh, go ahead!",6
"7","R1_1","21","21: Oh, thank you. So I'm X. I am at X University, so I have encouraged my students to do pre-registration for the manuscripts they are working on, and so I also have taught how to do pre-registration in a course. And for Ph. D. students. And I have also done some code-based...code code base using Github and train my students how to use Github, how to collaborate, and how to how to increase the transparency of their research. So in our published papers we have a shared all of our codes for experimental paradigms, and all the and also all the analysis scripts are available on both open science framework and also Github. And I have also paid the open access fee. A lot. And so, I'm also looking for recommendations about how to make this sustainable for our research group.",7
"8","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. And X, was that you that wanted to chime in? Go ahead.",8
"9","R1_1","20","20: Yeah, sure. I'm X. Nice to meet you all. I'm at X. And I guess I use very similar practices. So, I'd say most of my open science practices would be related to code sharing and data sharing so either on...I guess all of the data sharing I've done so far has been on osf.io. That website. I know that there are other websites that can be used, and I'm kind of not sure what...There are many options, and so I think I just kind of chose this one because it was free and easy to use. But I know that from my own field there's also open neuro, I think, has data sharing, and I haven't used that yet. But things like that. And then yes, we also have a lab Github, where, even as we're doing our analyses, I have all of my students use Github to have version controlled code. Usually we don't work completely openly at the beginning. So we will have private repositories for code while we're working on them. And then, when we are ready to submit our paper, we will make the publication ready one that can be reviewed. So, I know that some people do fully open as they're going, but we tend to, you know, have our sort of in-house version of the code and then our camera-ready version when we're happy with it. We put that as the public one that's released with the paper, or released during the review. The only problem I've had with that is recently I submitted to a conference where they required double blind review. And then it's kind of not possible to ha...I don't know how to do the double-blind code because there was no way to upload it, so we just didn't include it. But I felt like that was kind of a missed opportunity. So, if people know and have dealt with that, I'd love to hear that.",9
"10","R1_1","F","F: Thank you so much for sharing that. Oh, go ahead.",10
"11","R1_1","21","21: I'm just responding to X’s last comment. We were also asked to share our codes and our our experimental paradigms that have to be reviewed double in a double-blind fashion, and there are ways on OSF. You can create a double blind link without seeing the uploaders’ ID. Github, it's impossible.",11
"12","R1_1","F","F: Thank you for sharing that. Are there any other experiences the group would like to share using open science practices?",12
"13","R1_1","22","22: So hi everybody! My name is X. Just finished my first semester at X University. And I guess my experiences have been varied. So, I have a preprint of my Thesis Masters. So that's that's something that I did early on without really even knowing what open science was. And then during my doctorate, so I first published on data that was collected before I was there, and we did have someone reach out for the data. But it just never happened, and I know that we tried to publish like, trying to put something and register some...a couple of manuscripts, but it didn't happen because it was taking away time from the actual manuscript. I think part of the thing that we ran into is that all of us were learning how to do open science, including my PI. And there was a lot of hesitancy there of like, what do we need to do? What, what's good to put in? And then also just making sure that you're selecting the right area. So, like I do a lot in language and literacy and speech, and so like I know OSF is a good one, but I think there's a couple of new ones that have started that are specific more for that area. And then, like my dissertation data, I have it in my IRB that I can do it. But you know, life got in the way, and it just didn't happen, because it is something new, and it takes more effort. And I had to finish over that. So I kinda had to make choices along the way, but definitely would love to do that. And then, actually, in my Phd program, I learned how to use GitHub. But my PI didn't use R or anything like that. And so then it became more of like a niche for me, and no one used it, and so I haven't used it for a while. But I need to get back to it as I am starting to do a lot on my own. So, I've had like sprinklings of it, but not a whole lot of like follow through, and success with it so definitely an area I want to establish myself in, because I want this to happen. But I think I'm just like at the point where I'm I'm unsure, and we love support and resources to like guide me. Kind of like you're on the right track. Keep going! So that's where I'm at with it.",13
"14","R1_1","F","F: It looks like we lost Danika. I’ll text her. But I’m still taking notes and we’re still recording.",14
"15","R1_1","23","23: Oh, hi. Okay. Okay, yeah. So so I'm X at X University. So I also have like very limited experience with using like like open science. To me, there's like 2 parts: the first is publish in open access journals. So that's something, I think, as a very junior PI that's kind of a financial burdens a lot. So because, like where my PI has a lot of money. So I don't need to worry about that. But like for myself, that's something I think will be something I need to consider seriously when I’m thinking about which journal to submit to. So for the other part, I think it's just sharing the data, sharing the XX. I only recently try to kind of sharing my data for one of my recent papers...sharing the data and sharing also the experiment paradigm. There's a some...I think feels... the different platform, since had different requirements or different, like storage limit, like, for example, if we do each data. They're just huge. But for some of the platforms, they don't give you that amount of storage limit. Which is kind of a limit for some of them. So that's something I can...as I'm learning the process. I feel like I'm still trying to figure out which would be a good platform kind of, for sharing the data.",15
"16","R1_1","20","20: I guess...I had one more to share that. I forgot. Oh, sorry, X, you were going to go. Why, don't you go instead?",16
"17","R1_1","24","24: Oh, okay, all right. I was gonna say that I had attended one of the CSDisseminate workshops a couple of years ago that talked about how to figure out which version of your papers you're legally allowed to share, and I thought that was really helpful. And spent some time kind of going through my publications and figuring that out. And then never quite got to the point of getting everything posted on my website. But...on my lab website. But it's something that's on my To Do List. It's just been something that's been pushed to the bottom of the To Do List for kind of a long time, because it's really time consuming to go through all of those old papers and figure out, where is that final version of the accepted manuscript? And like figuring out the different things for different journals. So it's really just been sort of a time limitation that's kind of prevented me from following through on doing that at this point, even though I'd like to. Many of my papers are also one PubMed Central, because they were affiliated with an NIH-funded study. So I feel like I personally have a better understanding of of that of the publication open science possibilities. And I I haven't a lot of the data sharing kinds of things that others have talked about, and so that that feels to me more overwhelming at the moment in terms of knowing what to do and looking at the new NIH Grant requirements. There's a new like data sharing plan form that's much more in depth in talking about like repositories and things like that. And I I don't even know where sort of to begin with that at this point. I have to do some work in the next couple of months before my next submission to figure out exactly what is meant...I'm meant to do with that. So...motivated to learn. But I I do feel like there's a big learning curve and time commitment associated with figuring it all out.",17
"18","R1_1","F","F: Thank you for sharing great. So that kind of leads us into our next question, which I'm. Going to move us to for time's sake. What training experiences have you had, if any, about open science practices?",18
"19","R1_1","22","22: I guess my only formal one was in my stats courses that we used Github, but otherwise I haven't had any formal education about that. So.",19
"20","R1_1","20","20: This is kind of incidental, I guess I I would say similarly. I don't remember, if I had formal training on it. But I have been involved in a summer workshop called Neuro Academy, which is at the University of Washington. And they, it's very much about open science practices and the open Science community, and particularly code replicability and science replicability. And so I have been an instructor there. And so I've watched other people give talks, and that's actually helped me learn as well, even though I was not formally a student. But that's a great group.",20
"21","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any other trainings that anyone has received?",21
"22","R1_1","21","21: Similar to X. I don't have any formal training. I I mainly follow the openly accessible training materials by the Society for Neuroscience, and also there are open, open science framework. They have a lot of materials, such we can comb through about how to how to do open science. There are a lot of Youtube videos as well, and have a bookmark folder for those resources, and happy to share.",22
"23","R1_1","19","19: Similar to others. This is X and I did not receive any formal training in my doctoral program, my postdoc, or even on boarding as a new faculty member at my home institution. And so I've been finding that in order to learn more, it requires a lot of self study, and then, of course, finding the time and the bandwidth to move that item up on the priority list is always so challenging, although I really value it so it's it's been a bit of a struggle personally.",23
"24","R1_1","F","F: Okay, I'm going to move us on to the next question. What open science topics would you like to learn more about? So here are a few different topics of ideas. Maybe some of them will spark something, you remember hearing that word, and you want to learn more about it. So some of the different open science practices are pre-registration, self, archiving, gold open access, open data. Many of you have talked about some of these so far, open peer, review, and open educational resources. So which ones kind of stand out to you as ones that you would like to learn the most about?",24
"25","R1_1","21","21: For me, I'm still very interested in knowing what's the best way to share data. There are multiple platforms online, including open neuro and a few other...I’m blanking on the name  I can look it up and you put it on the chat. That's how accessible it is to the users in terms of uploading and downloading data. And so what what would be the most straightforward way to do it. I'm constant today at a loss. We have multi-modal data, including for example, video, audiom speech sample, that can be identifiable. They're They're just lot of issues that we need to deal with before uploading and the deidentifying to the best we can for data sharing. So I I think it requires more professional support than just self-training.",25
"26","R1_1","22","22: And going along with that, at what point you know, are you able to share your data like how much cleaning needs to happen. Besides deidentification. So like for example, I use Redcap. And so a lot of it comes down, and it's like this, and then a subhead, depending on what type of question you're asking. And I can just give a key with that? Or do I have to convert that because I do that when I'm running my scripts in R. But, so just understanding more about how much do you have to prepare your data. What's expected in that? And then also, I would love to to learn more about pre-registration, and then kind of thinking about also, if like I do...If I write them in... like I'm writing up my dissertation. Do like a preprint, or are there other options that are more efficient and effective because I do need to move it along. So just thinking more about those aspects.",26
"27","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. So we've heard open data, pre-registration, more about pre-prints. Are there any other topics that others would like to learn more about?",27
"28","R1_1","25","25: I'd be curious to know more about open peer review. I don't know that I i'm familiar with that term, and it just sort of struck me as interesting. So that's my two cents.",28
"29","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any others?",29
"30","R1_1","20","20: Yeah, I'd like to know...I guess all of these sound interesting, but the a lot of people have mentioned the financial burden of open access, so the gold open access. I know that I could preprint a study, but it's also nice to have. I don't know, like are there ways to get gold open access paid for if you don't have grant support for a particular project? That's what I would like to know.",30
"31","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Okay. We're gonna move on to the next question just for time seat. How would you prefer to learn about open science practices? Would you prefer to have a Webinar that you could access live, or a pre recorded Webinar, an interactive workshop, maybe, where someone could talk you through different steps. A handout that we could just send out to you to read over a Youtube video, or maybe something else. What do you think would work best for you for learning about open science practices?",31
"32","R1_1","22","22: For me? It would be really helpful to kind of do something where we can see information online. But then have a space to come to where we're working through something and we're stuck. So maybe it's, you know. Maybe you have a project that you're working on from the ground up. Or maybe it's something that you're trying to, you know, depending on the different focus. But I think, having the ability to do like pre-recorded stuff, or maybe interactive. But you can go back and look at it, and then have spaces to work on something and kind of like hold me accountable to coming back to it, and then also have questions and get those answers that are more specific to my type of data. Everybody has different data. And so there there can be different types of challenges. So...",32
"33","R1_1","F","F: Are you thinking that would be like a one-time event, or something that would be ongoing?",33
"34","R1_1","22","22: Maybe ongoing? So maybe it could be like 3-months...you could do like offerings of like 3 months, and you can apply to be in a cohort or something that can help. I find going longer than 3 months doesn't really happen, because you just get burnt out. But that would just, you know it could possibly be something over the summer or yeah, just different points, but that that could be something helpful to me.",34
"35","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Other thoughts on types of training formats?",35
"36","R1_1","23","23: Yeah, I think a combination of all those sounds great, because sometimes you like we are so busy like teaching all those kinds of things. Probably we don't have time to attend like a long like workshop thing, but it's always there some resource there we can revert to. Prerecorded, YouTube video, that would be helpful. Handout. Sometimes, if maybe we have our students. They can attend some workshops and to have some interaction more like direct interaction. That may be helpful. So I think a combination of all those things would be great. ",36
"37","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. And just so I understand you're saying it would also be nice if students could access these trainings as well.",37
"38","R1_1","23","23: Yeah of course.",38
"39","R1_1","F","F: Great. Thank you. Other thoughts?",39
"40","R1_1","19","19: I I agree with that. Like being able to. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, Sorry. I'll be brief. Being able to outsource this to research assistants with the ideal, I think, from a a managing, you know, resources standpoint. Also, I wish there was like a like a hotline like like 1-800-help me with open science stuff. So as the need like...I would love to say I would attend a webinar. But the honest truth is, I likely don't have the time to figure out how to make that work. But when the need pops up, and it's like really urgent, and in the moment, if I could go to like an FAQ site, or like, just have that resource at my fingertips like a open science coach that you could call or pop into, even, you know, asynchronously. That would be really, I think super helpful.",40
"41","R1_1","F","F: Thank you.",41
"42","R1_1","21","21: I I pasted a a website an example. I think this is really consistent to the X's suggestion it. This is a fellowship opportunity for trainees and junior faculty members certainly welcome to apply. I sent two post docs from my lab to attend the training, and the requirement is that they have to come back, and develop a course in their own community and teach other people. So I think this is a really really good format to to help expand the training opportunities and the the training fellowship. The the organization of this fellowship also provide a lot of infrastructure for teaching. So I think everyone who was involved was very happy including the later trainees in our Institute, who attended my postdocs’ course later on.",42
"43","R1_1","F","F: That sounds fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing that. ",43
"44","R1_1","20","20: Okay, I'm: just sorry. Can I add one more thing that I just thought of from X's comment?..What I would love actually is. So you know their FAQ sections. What if there was like a open science triage quiz, or something where you're online and it's like, what type of data do  you have behavioral data, video data, HIPAA sensitive data ,like you have some flowchart where then it directs you to the appropriate resources based on what you're trying to do like that would be super nice. I don't know if that exists. But I would want that.",44
"45","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. That's a great idea. Okay, now we're going to talk more about 4 different open science practices in more detail. The first is pre registration which some of you have already mentioned. This is the process of posting an outline for a proposed research project on a pre registration repository, such as the open science framework which some of you mentioned, OSF, before your data collection or analysis. Preregistrations typically include research questions, hypotheses, methods and an analysis plan. What do you perceive to be barriers in pre-registering your own studies?",45
"46","R1_1","24","24: I guess. To me, I mean this isn't a direct answer to this question, but I'm not really sure what the benefits are of preregistering my study. So I think I I need to have a better understanding of why it's beneficial to do that before putting the time into figuring out how to do that.",46
"47","R1_1","F","F: Thank you.",47
"48","R1_1","25","25: I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower. You know a lot of us have students, but it takes a while to get them trained. And this seems like something that would require some training from the PI if a student was going to assist with it. But yeah, I I I would. I would agree with X that if you don't necessarily see the benefit, then why why, invest the time in doing this. That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment.",48
"49","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any other barriers?",49
"50","R1_1","26","26: I don't see any barriers.",50
"51","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. There's no barriers that you're encountering in your own practice.",51
"52","R1_1","26","26: No, well the thing is, the thing is, what is the benefit? The benefit is that you get stuff published no matter what the outcomes are. I think that’s XXXX. ",52
"53","R1_1","F","F: Thank you.",53
"54","R1_1","26","26: I mean hopefully, right? So yeah. So I am, I'm very much in favor of preregistration. I haven’t done it myself yet. But I intend to.",54
"55","R1_1","F","F: Great, any other thoughts about barriers for pre-registrations?",55
"56","R1_1","21","21: I I can mention a benefit which is training students to think about design of the experiment in advance and to literature review to support their hypotheses. So I I use that as an opportunity to train my students how to write.",56
"57","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. We're going to stay on the same topic of preregistration. What factors currently facilitate your ability to be able to pre-register your studies for those that are using preregistrations, or what is something that you think might be able to facilitate your ability to preregister your own studies in the future?",57
"58","R1_1","21","21: I think it's the existing template that is very handy for people who are new to preregistration and look for the kind of information necessary for a preregistered report. And also the encouragement for registered reports in a by by different journals. So who can publish a register report without results? But it has to be a timely publication. It cannot be too long.",58
"59","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any other facilitators that help you to be able to preregister maybe any resources or things that might be in place to help you to be able to preregister? Okay, let's switch topics here. Now, we're gonna go on to the next open science practice that we'll discuss today, which is self-archiving. Self- Archiving involves making a version of a manuscript legally and freely available on a lab website, personal website, or in a repository. What do you perceive to be the barriers to self archiving your own work?",59
"60","R1_1","24","24: Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier.",60
"61","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Time. Other thoughts?",61
"62","R1_1","19","19: I would say IT support to get everything up on our University affiliated website. So making sure like, because I can't post directly to my my like University website. It has to go through our IT team. So that's sometimes super efficient. And other times really not.",62
"63","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Other thoughts?",63
"64","R1_1","22","22: For me. Sorry! I'll be quick. For me, understanding what are the things that I need to legally look out for, and just kind of making sure that it's all good before I do it. So that's kind of where I’m at.",64
"65","R1_1","26","26: For me. I'm sorry I do...We usually just use stored copies on on Research Gate and these websites. So you can post a link to that. For legal, for for for legal reasons, I never really worried about that, because I I I don't think it's a realistic threat. I don't think publishers are going to go after individual researchers for sharing, their their work on the Internet. So I think it’s, I don’t see XXXX the university. Might not agree with me. But I’ve always shared everything wherever, whenever people request it. No matter what.",65
"66","R1_1","F","F: Are there any barriers that you faced, or are you saying you haven't faced any yet?",66
"67","R1_1","26","26: Well, the only barrier is what what what the University's policy is. But if somebody sends you a PM on the Research Gate or whatever, you can share whatever you want.",67
"68","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. What factors currently facilitate your ability to self-archive your work or could facilitate your ability to self-archive your work in the future?",68
"69","R1_1","20","20: So for us, X, I'm sorry to hear that you can't access your own website. So now I'm really happy that I can. So my university does allow us to change our own, you know X affiliated website, and my research assistant can do it. So that's great. I think all universities should do that.",69
"70","R1_1","24","24: The the CSDisseminate workshop which I I went to, I think it was about 2 years ago, was extremely helpful in this, because it directed, and I can't remember the names of the websites off the top of my head, but I do have them written down. So there's like websites where you can go to and search the journal and figure out for that journal which version of your manuscript you're legally allowed to share, and the rules kind of associated with that. But it's also, it's like in a couple of different places you have to go look. Not everything is all in the same spot. So it's not always just like a super streamlined process, but just knowing those resources, and where to look for that information was really really helpful.",70
"71","R1_1","F","F: Any other thoughts on this question?",71
"72","R1_1","20","20: Maybe if the journal just once it was accepted, if they just, you know, send you an additional email with the PDF saying, here is the one that you can, self-archive. That seems like it would save time, for a lot of people",72
"73","R1_1","F","F: That would be excellent. Yes.",73
"74","R1_1","20","20: I don't know if they want to do that though.",74
"75","R1_1","F","F: Any other thoughts about this question, any other facilitators?",75
"76","R1_1","22","22: I think maybe finding people at my university, too, that like finding the people that want to do open science or are doing it successfully, may be helpful, because every university is so different, just even website accessibility. Thankfully, I can do it. But I think just having people with you at your university could be helpful. So like finding that cohort. It's not always explicit or clear who does this so. Or who is working towards it. So.",76
"77","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Okay, we're gonna move on to the third open science practice that we'll discuss today, which is gold open access. This is the process of paying a fee to publishers to make an article available for others to read for free. What do you perceive to be the barriers of publishing using gold open access?",77
"78","R1_1","19","19: Certainly the cost. I think that's the obvious answer, but especially the cost for junior investigators who might not have big you know, externally funded grants as we're building our program of research. And so some of the some of the smaller internal and external grants that are awarded early in your career just simply don't have the the budget to support that line item.",78
"79","R1_1","20","20: I agree, and they're also vastly different by journal. The amount of money that it is. I know somebody who recently had an article accepted to nature neuroscience, and their open access fee is $13,000. And so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much...They didn't pay it.",79
"80","R1_1","F","F: Any other thoughts on this question?",80
"81","R1_1","26","26: No, same. It’s just you have to figure in the amount of money beforehand. And I hope that some of the resources will, I mean, many universities are working to supporting open access fees because they are basically stating on the on the...what’s it called? Library costs.",81
"82","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. So it sounds like the cost, and and having a plan ahead of time of how you're going to pay for them. What factors currently facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access, or could facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access in the future?",82
"83","R1_1","26","26: Same thing money.",83
"84","R1_1","25","25: I think definitely money. But you know department chairs or deans really valuing, having this open access to your work, and so having that support that can kind of come from the top. So even if you don't have the grant funds to pay for it, maybe somebody in administration really sees the value for your career and for the institution. I know that I think I think I had...I think we paid for open access for one of my articles, and it came from our department's budget, because my chair was just very supportive and just wanted, really valued me being able to have this as part of my publishing record.",84
"85","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any other facilitators besides cost, having the money and having support from department chairs or deans?",85
"86","R1_1","21","21: Our university recently, they included Wiley and Springer, I think these two publisher...They said if you we choose to publish journals in these two publishers, the open access fee can be covered. If I understand that email correctly, it was from just a couple of months ago. X, if you have missed that email, we can read that email together.",86
"87","R1_1","24","24: I definitely did not see that email. I’ll have to go back and look for it. But that's exciting to hear.",87
"88","R1_1","21","21: Yes. University support. Definitely.",88
"89","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. That's great. Okay, the last open science practice we'll discuss today is open data. Open data is the process of publicly sharing research data or resources needed for data collection, such as methodology, protocols or software packages. Open data is typically made available online on online repositories. What do you proceed to be barriers to the open data process?",89
"90","R1_1","26","26: Okay, i'll go ahead. I think one of the barriers is is the value of the data set. I always feel that there is more in it than this. Just this one publication. So I'm, for for those reasons I'm reluctant to sharing, because I always think like there's like two more publications in this data set. So why would I give that away? So that’s a real thing. It just. Yeah. That’s it I guess.",90
"91","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Other barriers to the open data process?",91
"92","R1_1","23","23: So for me, I guess it's one of the things is like how to format the data, and also format the protocol in a kind of accessible way to others. I know like different labs do different things. So how to format in a way that everyone can understand. I think that's..sounds like takes a little bit of effort. It's really like when we writing code. Sometimes we understand our code, but not necessarily others understand our code. So, there's something, maybe, to learn about how to make more accessible.",92
"93","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Other barriers?",93
"94","R1_1","26","26: I actually think that that this is starting to be a discussion, though I'm sorry. But I actually think this accessibility might be be useful as a barrier. So only people who are really dedicated will will work on it. It’s accessible to everyone. But it's not  that that just everyone can just pick it up and do something with it.",94
"95","R1_1","F","F: Thank you.",95
"96","R1_1","26","26: I don’t know. What do you think?",96
"97","R1_1","F","F: Yeah. The others have thoughts on that or any other barriers that you're thinking of?",97
"98","R1_1","22","22: I think. Oh, sorry. I think mine kinda related to what they were saying earlier. I was talking about just like how to format it. But then, also you know, I use R and then I can get like a print out of what all the codes mean and everything. But then it's also trying to make sure that everybody understands the... I guess the the experiment itself, and the purpose of it, because I feel like that's always dangerous when you're sharing data. They may say, oh, there's a limitation in this data but it's like, well, that wasn't a focus. The focus was here. So I think there's just making sure interpretation of the data is done properly. And so how can I do that? But also make it less time and effortful, effortless? I guess you could say. While doing all of that, so make sense in my brain, but it might not make sense in theirs. So...",98
"99","R1_1","26","26: That interpretation difference is like the whole use of data sharing, right? To open up that that discussion.",99
"100","R1_1","21","21: Yeah. But I also agree with X. That's the the description of your whole experimental design takes time. You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata. That's you. You spend time to create and clarify. So I I I think the amount ofalso related to formatting as well. The the amount of work that you put into this need also to be supported by resources. It's time, and it. It need to be carefully done, and it requires technical skills, and also the the website I posted on chats, the data brewery video database. It... the paperwork it takes to get access. And to upload data was very lengthy, at least for me as a user just as a user I I didn't even upload my own data. I wanted to get access to a shareable data on the website. It took forever, just to get all the paperwork done so. These are all barriers, and will prevent people from contributing to this society.",100
"101","R1_1","F","F: Thank you for all...",101
"102","R1_1","20","20: I'm sorry I keep doing this. One quick one. Copyright of stimuli. So, I use stimuli that I'm really interested in natural speech perception. And so, we actually use some movie clip stimuli that are copyrighted. I think, under fair use it's fine to use them, but I can't share. I'm pretty sure that I can't share the stimuli online, but that would be super important for anybody who wants to use the raw data instead of just derived data that I've created. So, I'm not. I'm honestly not sure what I should do about that.",102
"103","R1_1","F","F: Yeah, that's a great point. Thank you for sharing that. Okay, in light of all these barriers, what are some factors that are currently facilitating your ability to use the open data process, or you think could facilitate your ability to use the open data process in the future.",103
"104","R1_1","22","22: Well, I'm starting new right now. So, I think that allows me to figure out okay, how much do I want to spend on this? And so it's not like I'm...haven't been doing it for a while in my lab, and so now I have the ability to make that choice so...but then again, at the same point, you need to have supportive individuals, and there's an and and I think people in my department are very supportive of it. It's just no one's really done it. So I think there's that aspect just getting that support which I know has been said. But yeah, so for me, that's where I'm at, and probably getting some support and kind of like leading me through, it would be helpful.",104
"105","R1_1","19","19: Yeah, I agree with X. I think it's like a culture issue. So, if it were the culture of the department in which you're working where this is just something that is standard practice. Then it might, I might be more likely to devote the time and energy to do it rather than trying to, you know. Find it within, you know, as a as working in a silo in just my research lab with my students and my research assistants.",105
"106","R1_1","24","24: I think one thing that could be a facilitator, or at least forcing people to do. Is like, I said, the NIH grants have requirements, updated requirements now for, like a very detailed plan about how you are gonna share your data. So, thinking through that ahead of time, like forcing you to think you through that ahead of time and come up with plan that you document and put in with grant applications, I would think, would likely be a facilitator. I think that the other thing, though, is it's not really people in our positions, in tenure track jobs, we don't get credit anywhere in like the tenure process for using open science practices, well versus not using them. And it is extra time and effort to do. So, I think you know one other thing is like if this was valued by institutions more, if this was something where you got, I don't know it's recognized in some way, or it was prioritized by institutions, that that would also, I think, motivate people to do this more.",106
"107","R1_1","F","F: Thank you, just for the sake of time. I'm gonna have us continue on. What impact do you think open science practices could have on the field of communication sciences and disorders, you might consider both research and clinical practice.",107
"108","R1_1","23","23: Well, I think one thing on my mind is, so. I I do research on cochlear implant. Like it's a kind of a patient group. So many of the study, you see, is very small simple size. So I'm wondering if there is open data everywhere, so someone can put them together. Maybe create like a larger data, a database, so that I can maybe help answer some of the questions I can't answer. I think there's something there. Sometimes I will frustrated. I can only get like 10 people for my study, and everyone's doing such things. So which may be okay, if some scenario but I don't for science. But so maybe that's not the best way to do this. So I think that will be very beneficial from that perspective.",108
"109","R1_1","F","F: Thank you for sharing. Other thoughts? Other impacts?",109
"110","R1_1","21","21: I think open science practice also increase the impact of our research, and to make it accessible to clinicians and the community. If we are able to keep our research as transparent as possible through open access journals.",110
"111","R1_1","20","20: I think. Oh, I I was gonna say I think it'll make the research more reproducible as well, because, even though it takes time, if people are encouraged either through positive or negative reinforcement to to do this, then, you know, if their data is formatted in a certain way, and they know how it's formatted. Then probably that code is gonna be more reproducible because you really had to think about presenting it to another audience to look at and use.",111
"112","R1_1","22","22: I think it also gets us out of as researchers. It gets us out of our silos. So it allows us to be more collaborative, which is very important, and it allows for also more interdisciplinary practices to happen as well. So, and I think it's just it's it's demonstrating your willingness to work with others, and that you care. And that you're willing to grow and change as well. So, this is what I did now. Can't wait to do more in the future, hopefully, even better. So that's kind of just in general what I kind of think and what I've heard others talk about with me about open science.",112
"113","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. And related to that. What impact do you think open science practices could have on your career, if any?",113
"114","R1_1","20","20: I think building community is a big one. The Neuro Academy workshop that I was involved in. I've met other people through that. And then I've had invitations to give talks through that. So that's actually been a positive outcome of working with that community.",114
"115","R1_1","26","26: I don't know. I actually actually wonder what effect does it have if other people publish something using your data set that they got through open science. What is the impact of it? And I I don't know. I really don't know. Is it is going to positively affect your tenure evaluation, or is it just a publication for somebody else who mentions you in the acknowledgments? I have no idea. To hit back back to the first question, the the previous question. For the field, I'm I'm I'm hoping that it will change focus of the field more onto like like truth-seeking versus career management. If that makes sense. But that’s a difficult one.",115
"116","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Thank you for your thoughts. Any other final thoughts on this question about the impact of open science on your career?",116
"117","R1_1","21","21: I'll just add two quick points. One is, I think, the it gives me confidence and increase the reproducibility of my own research, but it requires a lot of time investment to to get the process right. So it does also have this sinking cost in in your, in your tenure track. And I, yeah, I I I'm definitely on the fence, when, at the moment, I feel like that requires a lot more support than I have already had.",117
"118","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. I see we are right at our time here. And our last question is, what did we miss? Are there any final comments that anyone would like to make about open science practices that we haven't discussed today, and if you have to jump off, go ahead and do that as well. I want to be respectful of your time, but I'll just leave the floor open for any final comments",118
"119","R1_1","19","19: I have to run. But thank you, X, and everybody. It was good to see you, meet, all of you. Thank you.",119
"120","R1_1","20","20: I think, actually having this meeting was helpful. I learned some new things from this. So maybe there should be more things like this.",120
"121","R1_1","F","F: Thank you. Any other thoughts?",121
"122","R1_1","21","21: And what what would be the outcome of this research?",122
"123","R1_1","F","F: So we are hoping that this will inform the future trainings that we design for CSD as part of Open CSD.Which is a new group that's forming. That's a kind of a sister organization to CSDisseminate, and it's focused solely just on open science. But there's so much to cover as we all have discussed today. So, we're hoping to find out what's of interest to the most amount of people. And that way we can really tailor our time that we're dedicating to what people really want to know and understand. And so we're hoping that over the next couple years that we'll start to be able to impact some of this, and share information in a really accessible way, so that more people can use open science practices. All right. Thank you all so much for your time I really appreciate it. It's been great to hear all of your thoughts.",123
"124","R1_2","F","F: Open science refers to a collection of research practices that aim to increase the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. What experiences have you had using open science practices, if any? And you can go ahead and just unmute and jump in.",1
"125","R1_2","27","27: I'll start. My first experience with open science has been publishing a protocol for a scoping review on Open Science Framework.",2
"126","R1_2","28","28: I can go. I have a couple of papers that have like R scripts and data files on an OSF repository.",3
"127","R1_2","29","29: Yeah, I've been trying to publish code associated with with papers usually on OSF as well as make free versions of our papers available. And sometimes pre-prints available as well.",4
"128","R1_2","30","30: We do pre-prints for everything these days on site archive or OSF, I've been trying to get better at putting the code up for R up on OSF. We've been getting more consistent with that, but we do put all of our accepted papers that are unformatted on there as well as pre-prints. And we've been trying to get better at doing registered, pre registered reports and things like that on OSF, wherever it's, wherever we're looking at archive data.",5
"129","R1_2","31","31: I was. I was gonna add that I try to really could as much supplemental and extra appendices like things, if I have work that I think is clinically relevant, or I want to be able to have SLPs who are going to be able to try to replicate our use. So I try to add as much as I can and then also trying to share publications. But I also know that I have a lot to learn about open science and want to improve those practices. So I feel like I think I do more than I realize, but I I consider myself as being new to this area, and wanting to learn and grow and figure out how to do it better.",6
"130","R1_2","27","27: I agree with that. And part of the reason I participated in the focus group is to learn more about what other people are doing.",7
"131","R1_2","32","32: We've been working to have all of Our MRIs and EPRIMES uploaded to a platform which isn't exactly open. You still have to request access, but it's all of the raw data.",8
"132","R1_2","33","33: I actually haven't used a lot of open science practices myself, I would say. I think I've benefited from other people using it, which is helpful to to see how useful it can be, and does motivate me to to learn more about it, and to use use more of them, I guess. But to agree with some of the other points about. There probably are some pieces that I'm already doing at parts of and need some more knowledge to to use more open open practices.",9
"133","R1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing that. I'm wondering how you've benefited from others using open science practices. In what way?",10
"134","R1_2","33","33: Yeah, I've definitely looked at other people's code and taken pieces of code. And I really like when people publish stimuli because that's always a big thing that I think about is they get these results. And what stimuli did they actually use? And how does that compare to my, the stimuli that I've used? So those are some of the biggest ones. I also really have looked at a lot of pre-prints. I think that is a great practice. I think it just feels. I mean, I'm sure we'll get into some of this, but so overwhelming to think about where to start with these things right? And so...but it is nice to to see how it's helped me, and so hopefully, that will be something I can use in the future.",11
"135","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. That's very helpful. Any other experiences that you all have had using open science practices?",12
"136","R1_2","28","28: Do you want us to? So like that some of the things people mentioned I have done? But I didn't mention the first time. Do you want us to jump back in? So you have like full representation?",13
"137","R1_2","F","F: Sure. Yeah, you're welcome to comment on anything that has resonated with you so far.",14
"138","R1_2","28","28: Okay, just one paper I'm on. We have a Pre print and a new IRB protocol we submitted has built into the consent, a place where they can consent to their data being made publicly available. This is one thing we've kind of struggled within the past is whether it is a violation of people's consent to put their MRI scans online for clinical populations, for example, even if their skull stripped and everything if they didn't consent. So there are some like gray areas where we weren't quite sure what to do. So now we're trying to be more explicit. Upfront. But yeah. I agree also with X that I've benefited from other people posting their things online.",15
"139","R1_2","29","29: I mentioned is, look at. Oh, I was just gonna echo right, being a consumer specifically of code, has been really, really useful for me. And then also trying to work language into the IRB to be more open with data going forward as a goal. I think that was always gonna say.",16
"140","R1_2","30","30: Yeah, it's definitely a moving target with IRBs. We've we've had some issues with that for sure. So we're working on it. But it's it's a hard one. And the other experience I've had is paying multiple thousands of dollars for open access to things which I'm sure people here have done also, which is a huge barrier for those of us who are all early in our career, because it's like, don't know how much I have laying around. That's, you know, $12,000 for 4 papers. So that's the other fun experience I've had.",17
"141","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I agree. Being a consumer is something that I've done particularly with stimuli for experiments. I also had. I took the CSDisseminate I guess zoom presentation about how to make your website have all of the articles on it. And so my lab website includes links to download the freely available version of our published papers. But then also we created a Google form that allows people to add their email address requesting papers that are not publicly available so that we can send them to them another way.",18
"142","R1_2","F","F: Thank you all. Just for time's sake. I'm gonna move us on to the next question.",19
"143","R1_2","F","F: What training experiences have you had if any, about open science practices?",20
"144","R1_2","29","29: For me, the only explicit training experiences would have been through CSDisseminate webinars.",21
"145","R1_2","33","33: Yeah, same for me.",22
"146","R1_2","32","32: I’ve had a few trainings at conferences. Some through CSDisseminate, but also at ASNR, the  American Society for Neurorehabilitation. They have some talks usually about big data and trying to use consistent outcome measures. And open science practices.",23
"147","R1_2","30","30: Mine's been like 99% twitter and 1% conference probably. If I'm being honest.",24
"148","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I I echo the big social media influence for open science. And then also the CSDisseminate events.",25
"149","R1_2","34","34: I was just gonna say, also, I I've had very...",26
"150","R1_2","F","F: X, it looks like you were speaking... ",27
"151","R1_2","34","34: Sorry about that my screen was blinking on and off, and so I can't see anything for a few minutes, but I'm sorry. What I was just gonna share was I have not had direct training either, like like some of the others, but mostly experience, I guess exposure at conferences, and then but very little, I would say.",28
"152","R1_2","F","F: Thank you.",29
"153","R1_2","31","31: I also haven't had any real trainings, and I would say some of that is I need to reach out, and I I I have an interest that I have no training and I don't know if that's because I'm not seeking it out, or I don't know where to seek it out. I'm learning some tips already from this group. But I don't have any. I have never attended a a conference or a seminar, or anything.",30
"154","R1_2","28","28: The library, the librarians at  host a training on how to put your papers into repositories that people can access. We the the it was like a 1 hour long workshop, or something like that. But we learned about how if you put your papers on Research Gate, you're basically giving Research Gate the right to use all of your figures and do all these things that you didn't know you were giving them the rights to and and showing us how to get our papers off of Research Gate, and then move towards repositories through the university. But, there's so many people interested in it that the waitlist is very long, and we it's been like 8 months now, and I still haven't been contacted for that. But ostensibly I know how to put papers on an repository that people can access.",31
"155","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. All right, we're going to move on to the next question, what open science topics would you like to learn more about? And we just listed some here as examples, but feel free to talk about others as well.",32
"156","R1_2","31","31: Kind of related. This answers this new question, but off of what X was saying, I want to share my papers more and better, and I'm gonna say, one time I tried the first time I ever tried to share something I got in trouble or told like this can't go on there. And I was like, “Oh, no!” And so I feel like I'm not sure you know which public.. how to share them, you know, when you're submitting, you get something you have to sign like, you know, we're giving our paper to the publisher. So I...clearly there's a way to do. I have some available my website. And I'm still not sure like, are those supposed to be there? So yeah, I feel like I got I was told to take down something the first time I tried to share it. I'm sure it's a lot of operator error, and just me not doing the right trainings, but I don't know which articles we're allowed to share, how to share them. Things like that.",33
"157","R1_2","28","28: I agree.",34
"158","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I agree also even after the CSDisseminate talk about self archiving, we still, in the in my lab, are struggling to find the rules for each publisher, and it seems like every time we look they are a little bit different. So that's been a really big challenge. I recently saw a website of a calling in CSD who has a disclaimer on her website that says, by visiting this website and clicking this link that is personal contact with me. And I'm sharing my personal copy with you. Which I thought was a very creative way around it. But I don't know how legal it is, and so learning more about that would be really good. I also don't know what open educational resources are. So that would be a good thing to learn about.",35
"159","R1_2","32","32: Oh, I'm just gonna say it's like the only way I know how to share my papers is when NIH yells at me that we to share them. Like I I don't know how else to do it, so sometimes I just put collaborators’ NIH grants in my acknowledgments so that they'll yell at me so that I can put it on PubMed central.",36
"160","R1_2","30","30: Yeah, I preprint everything, because as far as I've been able to tell you cannot be yelled at for preprinting because it's not owned by a publisher yet. But the one thing that, uh oh, I just blanked on what I was going to say...self-arching...Oh, yeah. The one thing I was gonna mention is, I've actually had a cease-and-desist letter from a publisher about the linking your own personal copy. So just per X's comment there, I'm not sure even that gets you away from that I've actually and of course it was Elsevier. I mean, you could also do that? But anyway, so typically, we just link to pre-prints and as far as I know, as long as you update the pre print to the accepted version, I've learned, it's okay. But I'd also like to learn more about the open educational resources and open peer review scares me as a platform. But I'd like to learn more about that.",37
"161","R1_2","29","29: I think I'd like to learn about how to be more efficient in my workflow for building in open science practices. So for example, I I I know the mechanics behind getting you know a paper up before it's formatted by the journal for post prints or pre prints, and I know the mechanics of putting my code up on OSF and making it available. But I feel like all of that takes a lot of additional time for me. Making sure that even if it's not the final formatted version of a paper, it's still in a format that I feel really confident is very, very, very close to what's gonna finally get published. And for code I haven't figured out how to do that efficiently, because my code is always a slew of comments to myself that I don't necessarily want on...accessible to everyone. More just because it's very informal to me. And so there always feels like there needs to be a cleaning step which just feels unnecessary, but also necessary. So learning how to just build it in in a way that's more efficient towards the end, goals of making it open is something I'm interested in. Also interested in learning more about the open peer review and educational resources, neither of which are super familiar to me.",38
"162","R1_2","33","33: It's a really good point, yeah, about making...or how to make your practices efficient and work for because it does just feel, I mean, at least at this point for me feels like this extra big step that is like, how do I even do this with everything else going on? And then I'm really interested in in open data. I mean, I think a lot of us in our field deal with small ns. And so how to to use data from other researchers to help bolster our numbers. And I mean particularly for what I do using speech samples is always a challenge with IRB and how you know, sharing that data. And but I think it's so important. And how how do we do that, and how you navigate the IRB to make that happen. I think are big challenges that I'm interested in learning more about.",39
"163","R1_2","34","34: I was just gonna say, of all the things on your question there, I have the most experience with the open educational resources, just because at my last institution there was funding from the university if you made OER. And then there was also, like a fairly big repository, I guess, through our library of open educational resources. So I am very interested in that and doing that, perhaps, but I agree with most others in saying a lot of it is knowing what to do. Pre-print. What can I? You know what's mine? What's theirs? And I feel like we get. I I feel like there's a lot of information out there about that. But I don't feel like it ever all agrees, so I never kind of hear one consistent report on this is what you can or can't do. I have actually heard the safest way is preprint like everyone else. But I'd be interested in learning more about all of them.",40
"164","R1_2","F","F: Thank you all. I really appreciate all of your participation so far. How would you prefer to learn about open science practices? And we've listed some potential options here live or pre-recorded webinars, interactive workshops, handouts, Youtube videos. But any other ideas that you're thinking of that might be helpful please share as well.",41
"165","R1_2","28","28: I really prefer something that is live or interactive. If it's pre-recorded, I will almost certainly never make the time to view it. Unless it's like, I need to know this right this minute. So really, something that's more hands-on, interactive, works best for me. Personally.",42
"166","R1_2","27","27: I agree with that. I think also having some resources like Youtube videos or handouts would be good in training graduate students as well if they cannot be at the interactive workshop. I, after I did the CSDisseminate live webinar I came back to the students who work with me in my lab, and we talked about it, and it was, I wish that I had had some handouts so that I could walk them through the things that I had learned.",43
"167","R1_2","34","34: I would always say interactive something that's, some kind of workshop that's interactive. ",44
"168","R1_2","31","31: I agree. And I think I heard some of you mentioned earlier that you had some training at different conferences. And so I think that might be a time. If there's conferences that I don't know if ASHA is like too big or something. But if if there was a similar talk that could be taken to some of the, you know, smaller interest conferences. If we're already there and kind of an attending audience, then better chance that the information is taken in. Maybe?",45
"169","R1_2","33","33: I agree that I that I think webinars are really interactive. You know, interactive webinars are really nice. But I think to some like bite-sized Youtube, or some kind of video that it's like, if there's one piece of it that you don't know how to do. Instead of like trying to find for this whole big recording where that piece is, I think would be really nice. Yeah, because sometimes it's like, okay, I have this hour-long webinar. But I need to know this one little thing right? And how do I find that?",46
"170","R1_2","29","29: Yeah, to that end I think things like cheat sheets are really useful, like brief handouts, or, you know, a page on a site or something. I know a lot of people really like like short videos like Tik Tok style videos. For that reason I can't get myself to learn very easily from that. But the written and visual version of that sort of static version, I find really useful for for some things related to open science practices.",47
"171","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, like an infographic almost.",48
"172","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. Now, we're going to move on to discuss four different open science practices in more detail. The first one we'll talk about is preregistration which some of you have already mentioned today. This is the process of posting an outline for a proposed research project on a preregistration repository such as the Open Science Framework, before data collection or analysis, preregistrations typically include research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan.",49
"173","R1_2","F","F: What do you perceive to be barriers to pre registering your own studies? And these could be things you've already encountered, or things that you think you might encounter if you tried to preregister a study.",50
"174","R1_2","30","30: I ask a clarifying question?",51
"175","R1_2","30","30: Yes. Are we? Are we differentiating between you, preregistering on something like OSF versus, like the registered reports that you submit to a journal?",52
"176","R1_2","F","F: Just for now preregistering like OSF.",53
"177","R1_2","30","30: Okay. Our biggest barrier, is to X's point time, when to do that, and when to submit it, and in more cases than I'm proud to admit we've submitted it at a stage where we have to select basically, we've collected it already. And we're submitting this preregistered report prior to looking at the data. But like we've already done most of the collection, which is, you know, a little bit later than I'd like, but it's mostly just the time aspect of getting it in.",54
"178","R1_2","27","27: We struggled with the actual process of putting the the protocol up on OSF. We found it really confusing about what kind of project or document we were putting up and ended up with two different projects, I guess. Then one of them you could change one of them you couldn’t, and when you can find XX and one you can't. And so it was really hard navigating Open Science Framework by ourselves, even with the help of our librarian. So that's been a big challenge for us.",55
"179","R1_2","28","28: I'll just echo that time has been a factor. And then, I think, like some sort of amorphous concern that putting it out there. And I I think this is probably something that's not grounded in any sort of reality. But like that, putting it out there will give somebody else the idea to then run away with my project. That isn't really the main barrier. It's just kind of like this back of my mind kind of thought. But mostly it's time, confusion about how to do it, what details I need to have, how much detail to go into, those kinds of things. And some of it, too, that's been, probably there's probably real easy to find answers for this. But, like the analysis plan, do I need to have alternative analyses if, like, my data don't need the assumptions for the first proposed analysis, like how much detail.",56
"180","R1_2","33","33: For me it kind of feels like more of a change in mindset that needs to happen. I think of like, why this is important, and that I should spend the time on it. Because if I'm being totally honest that, you know, because I wasn't trained, none of us were trying to do this. And so it does feel like this big thing to add on to the beginning, or wherever in your project, and so something like, just realizing why it's so important, hopefully, might motivate me to to actually take the time and effort needed to do it.",57
"181","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. So it sounds like this the time that it requires the process of figuring out what to do, and when and just the confusion that surrounding this issue. What are some factors that currently facilitate your ability to pre register your own studies, or you imagine might help you in the future if you decide that you want to pre register your own studies?",58
"182","R1_2","32","32: I never pre registered a study, but when I read them, it it's like a Grant application. And so I feel like I already have them written. I just don't do it.",59
"183","R1_2","F","F: Is there anything that you think might help you actually put it in place and preregister it?",60
"184","R1_2","32","32: Time?",61
"185","R1_2","F","F: Time. Thank you.",62
"186","R1_2","32","32: I also, I guess I kind of have this concern. It's like a cooks in the kitchen concern. Because you never know if the reviewers that you get for your pre registration are going to be the same review as you get for your grant. And so then, when you need to go, submit your, resubmit your grant, you've now had to modify, based on two different sets of reviewer feedback.",63
"187","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. Other facilitators?",64
"188","R1_2","31","31: I would just add, I haven't done this at all. So it's like, so I mentioned before, all this like kind of quick, just more information on the how to’s I imagine everything you said would be barriers for me if I would have tried to do this before. But I haven't. And so just no more information of how to and which types of projects. I guess I haven't thought to do this at the time, because I thought some of the projects I'm doing, though it's just a quick little pilot thing or...so I guess more information on what can go in and how to how to do it.",65
"189","R1_2","29","29: Also go back to the point of thinking about the pay off of it. Right. If if pre registration was a surefire way to get feedback from either from peer reviewers or from, you know, maybe not formal peer review. Then I think I would see the value of doing it for more projects.But right. Given the trade off of of time versus obvious, payoff for some smaller projects or even larger projects. I think that something more concretely obvious to me, would be a facilitator, I guess.",66
"190","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I agree. It's not clear that right now that the time that is required to do all this stuff actually helps us at this stage. And I think, knowing also what resources are already available at the universities where we work is, could be potentially helpful like X, mentioned the library having this training about self-archiving, I want to look up and see if my university has that and because I I feel like as junior people when we come to a university, often it feels overwhelming that we forget to look for the resources that they make available to us.",67
"191","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. We're going to move on to the next practice now, self-archiving. Self-archiving, involves making a version of a manuscript legally and freely available on the lab website, a personal website or in a repository. What do you proceed to be the barriers to self-organizing your work?",68
"192","R1_2","32","32: I know for me. I don't have access to my website. It's run by the PR at the university. And it's just, you know, six extra emails for me to get the paper up there. Per paper. ",69
"193","R1_2","28","28: Yeah. And for that reason I just link to my Google Scholar profile. Which means that I need to have the papers in a repository that is searchable by Google Scholar or findable. I don't actually know. Probably both. And so then I get confused about like, well, where can I put these that they will be findable through the one avenue I've given people to find my work.",70
"194","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I would agree with that. The lack of control of the university run website is a big barrier. I am able to put links on mine but I have to go through our department administrator, who isn't very tech, savvy. And so that is a huge barrier for me.",71
"195","R1_2","34","34: I would agree. This is something that I want to do, anyway. So time isn't actually really a barrier for me here, I would do this. The barrier for me is the legality as we talked about before, and you know, what are you allowed to do when you're not allowed to do? That's really the barrier for me. And I guess so I guess time is a little bit, because the time that it takes to look into all of that, and then trust that I understood it right. I guess that I guess that part is maybe a time barrier. But really it's it's more about not having the knowledge of what we can and kind of can't do, and where.",72
"196","R1_2","29","29: I think the time element resonates for me. But in the stage of preparing whatever I have to make freely available. So, for example, some journals require that you submit the figures as separate attachments, and so then they appear at the end of the manuscript. As a reader I really don't like reading things that way. So I do want to take the time to put the figures and the captions and the tables in where they would be. But again, that feels like this extra set of steps. And then there's other, you know, versions of that same sort of dilemma of how much modification to make to something, just to make it freely available. Not just to make it freely available. That's very important. But if I'm just trying to get it closer and closer to what the final published version looks like it...Right? It it's again this sort of time-effort trade off.",73
"197","R1_2","27","27: I found that I, still a student, is a really great resource to do all of those formatting things, and I've had a couple of students do that for me. Even undergraduate students are pretty good at working with word and that saves me a lot of time.",74
"198","R1_2","29","29: That's a great point, because that also gets the students thinking about open science practices early on. Thank you for that.",75
"199","R1_2","F","F: Let's move on to facilitators. So what factors currently facilitate your ability to self, archive your work, or could facilitate your ability to self, archive your work in the future?",76
"200","R1_2","27","27: Student helpers. And then resources like CSDisseminate, and our librarians.",77
"201","R1_2","33","33: The CSDisseminate resources for me were really big for this. I feel especially when you publish in similar journal, or the same journals, or whatever. I feel more and more confident that I'm doing it the right way to which helps a lot, because I do think that that's a barrier is being nervous about doing it wrong. And then also seeing that colleagues at similar stages in their career, looking at their websites and seeing how they did it and seeing that it doesn't actually look as scary as you think it is has been really helpful for me, and that I'm like I can do this, too.",78
"202","R1_2","29","29: One of the resources that CSDisseminates provides is a template for the blurb to include at the top of the manuscript, and I always just copy paste that in and I find that really helpful to have really concrete wording and placement in addition to right websites, to look up exactly how to do it. Depending on the journal that you're publishing in.",79
"203","R1_2","F","F: Alright. Thank you. Let's move on to the third topic, the third open science practice we'll discuss is gold open access. This is the process of paying a fee to publishers to make an article available for others to read for free. What do you perceive to be the barriers of publishing using gold? Open access?",80
"204","R1_2","27","27: The fee.",81
"205","R1_2","28","28: Yeah, for sure. The money. When you're in a lab that has a ton of funding, great let's do it. And when you are almost out of your startup funds, and you’re a new faculty like this is not the top priority for where that funding goes.",82
"206","R1_2","30","30: I think it's ethically ambiguous, actually like, I think it encourages a lot of big labs to get a lot more views than little labs. And I think it's also I mean, we already sell our figures and our text to publishers period. So now we're paying them to do it. So I think it's ethically very odd. So I kind of try not to. And I try to just pre-print, because I'm uncomfortable with the current ethics of it.",83
"207","R1_2","34","34: I agree with all of that. Nothing more to add. All of that. Yes.",84
"208","R1_2","32","32: There are some smaller society journals. It's kind of a balance between like a less impactful journal that's open access and a more impact for a journal that's gonna cost $3,000 plus the open access fee which I don't have and don't want to pay. But you know it's like Neurobiology of Language isn’t indexed in PubMed and so then what are you even publishing there for? But it is free for people to access. So.",85
"209","R1_2","F","F: X, did you want to add something?",86
"210","R1_2","31","31: Oh well, some of what I was going to say it's already been been shared. And just yeah, I always wondered, even with for open access. I think we all have a problem with we're doing all this work, and it goes to other publishers, and it's not ours. And we don't get compensated for being authors or being reviewers. That's like a side thing I think we all struggle with. But then adding what X was saying, that we’re gonna pay for it seems like it shouldn't come on us. And then I think what some of you were saying there's different. I don't really know. You know, it's like there's all these open access journals popping up, and some of them maybe, aren't great. Or I've been, you know. We all get emails, and I've been warned. Oh, some of those are scams. They just want your money. Then it seems enticing, because they usually get published faster. And we all need publication. So again, just not really. Well, it's not really been an option for me, because my startup is running out, so I don't even have this money so, but I have thought about it, and wondered should I do it? And when I had the chance I didn't for kind of a mix of all the reasons that have been shared.",87
"211","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I agree, I think, prioritizing it is questionable in my mind, because it's not clear to me what the payoff is at this point for science or for my career. like I I I get that, you know, tangentially, yes, it's better for everything to be accessible to everyone. But I just wonder how many more people would my article actually reach if it were gold open access versus if I am just, you know, telling everybody, hey, I'll email it to you if you email me.",88
"212","R1_2","33","33: That's a really great point. I think it would be really interesting to to being researchers to have data on how much of a difference it actually makes. I would be really interested to know that",89
"213","R1_2","30","30: The Nih also accepts preprints now in bio sketches and whatnot. So I really think the gold open access is losing its pull because it's like, why bother if NIH accepts a preprint as evidence. So I think it's an interesting future question.",90
"214","R1_2","28","28: I think some people are touched on this, and it's not a barrier of publishing per se, but like a drawback of some of these open access journals of yeah, we get the reviews very quickly. But there are a bunch of people in my department on a soap box about how these papers aren't worth anything, even if it's good science, right? Just because Frontiers, for example, yeah, it's open access. But anyone can get published there, right or whatever. So.",91
"215","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. Let's move on to factors that currently facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access or could facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access in the future.",92
"216","R1_2","29","29: Yeah. My current university is a subscriber to some of the gold open access options for certain journals, and so publishing through those is easier because the university picks up the tab. And so that is obviously a huge facilitator, because it doesn't come out of my own account.",93
"217","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I would agree with that. My university also has an agreement with a couple publishers for gold open access, but none of them are big speech and hearing journals. So it's it. It's a potential facilitator, but it hasn't actually come to fruition yet.",94
"218","R1_2","29","29: I'll just tack on to that really quick, too. Because, yeah, we we've published in one, or we're in the process of publishing in one. But the time was so poor, like the timing, compared to non-gold open access that I don't even think I would use that route again, even though the university picks up the tab for it, because the time it took to actually get it published was atrocious.",95
"219","R1_2","30","30: My universities and R1, I think many of us here at our R1 or similar. And you have to apply for like an open access fund for not covered ones. But most of the publishers want the money within like 2 weeks of acceptance, and that is just not gonna to happen with getting funds from the university that fast. So the idea is nice, but the whole, like how it pans out is not so great.",96
"220","R1_2","32","32: Is there? I'm sorry this may not be relevant to the question. But is there a CSD specific open access preprint platform? Or are you guys just publishing on whatever the biology one is?",97
"221","R1_2","30","30: I do OSF. They have a preprint section that attaches to your project already, which I really like, because it's all in one place. But I think CSisseminate has some...they were thinking of doing a repository. Sorry if you guys already did that. I've not kept up. But otherwise I used to do PsyArXiv was the one that we did.",98
"222","R1_2","F","F: Yeah, I can say we don't. We don't have one, but a lot of us in the group do use OSF. Any other factors that could facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access.",99
"223","R1_2","27","27: I'll just bring in from our last question data that shows it's worth it would be a facilitator.",100
"224","R1_2","33","33: And I think, to X's point previously about this, like stigma kind of with some of the journals anyways. And I'm not even totally sure if that's true or not right? So like education about actually, you know what it means. And if it's a bad thing, right? Then how do committees look at like tenure committees look at that? Things like that.",101
"225","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. The last open science practice we'll discuss today is open data. Open data is the process of publicly sharing research data and or resources needed for data collection, such as methodology, protocols or software packages. Open data is typically made available on online repositories. What do you perceive to be barriers to the open data process?",102
"226","R1_2","28","28: I think that it was X who said this before about like having to clean up your data, your protocol or code, or whatever it is that you have created for yourself. Yeah, lots of internal notes that makes sense to me, but would look really ridiculous if I put them out for everyone to see. So just knowing, like a a kind of general good format for these things.",103
"227","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I echo that.",104
"228","R1_2","30","30: Ours has been the IRB just changing what it interprets as shareable versus not like having we didn't used to have to get explicit yes’s to X's point earlier of sharing Xyz. Now it's explicit yes, which is what it should be. But they've just changed, you know, having to require that. And then, if you're like, I collaborate with tons of universities. So then you have to set up a data sharing agreement which goes through legal, which takes three months to do and so you've just got some locality attached to it, too, and it slows everything down, and or you just don't pursue it.",105
"229","R1_2","29","29: The moving target nature of the IRB also plays a role and and in the specifically with with what level of data you want to share. So we haven't run into any issues sharing like derived acoustic measures, and data of that form. But I'd love to be able to share speech samples actual, you know, audio recordings? And in some institutions, one of my previous institutions that that itself is considered personally identifiable data, just the audio recordings of speech. And that's not the case everywhere but even at institutions where it's not the case, I think making sure to incorporate that and make it really transparent to participants for example, that that's one of the goals is is just...There's just a lot of issues wrapped up in how to do that ethically from both an open science practice and working with with individuals who you're asking to participate in these ways.",106
"230","R1_2","F","F: Thank you. Let's talk about the facilitators. What factors currently facilitate your ability to use the open data process or could facilitate your ability to use the open data process in the future?",107
"231","R1_2","32","32: The main imaging group that I work with at  is really big, and I think they have the power to...I wouldn't say like overcome the IRB, but I think they have the power to request more lenient rules from them, then the rest of us do. And so then we're all able to kind of slide it under that, using their platform which is nice, especially for MRIs. De-identified MRIs.",108
"232","R1_2","33","33: I think it would be really helpful to have some examples of IRB language that's worked for other people. I know. I mean, obviously, they're all different. But you know, just some ideas of things that can get you started.",109
"233","R1_2","28","28: Yeah, I I agree with that completely. Right now, we have the IRB approving for putting things open if we have consent from the participant for a neurotypical group of young adults. I don't know, like we had trouble even getting our IRBs through for people with aphasia, because who can consent if you have a language disorder, and so then the like if I had that much trouble, just getting a basic behavioral study through, will I also never get an IRB be approved for people with aphasia to consent to have their data open. So that this is yeah been the main problem, and especially for speech production stuff like...numbers like a my eye tracking study where we have on OSF, it's just numbers. There's nothing identifiable. There was no question that we could put that up there. But with MRI or production, or EEG, or like anything that could, I mean, EEG not. But yeah.",110
"234","R1_2","33","33: The good point too I guess, this goes back to barriers. But having had the experiences we've had with IRB and data sharing, it does feel very daunting to to try to get something like this through when you've had such hard and challenges with it in the past. Right? so I don't know. Sorry. That's not really. There's no facilitator in there, but I think it's a good point.",111
"235","R1_2","27","27: I think, having people who are more senior in CSD support junior people's effort to practice open science would be helpful. Like, I'm in a department where literally everyone has been here for over 20 years, and none of them are doing open science because they don't. They don't need it. They they don't perceive that it's important. And so it feels like, even if I were to like intrinsically be motivated to do it, there would be barriers, because I don't have the support of the senior people around me. And also just having someone to look at as an example. You know, to say, this is what they did. I think would be really helpful.",112
"236","R1_2","30","30: Yeah, this is fresh in my mind, because I'm like deep in doing this right now, but like the tenure process doesn't care, they literally don't care. And so there's no incentive there whatsoever like never have I been asked about it, Like I make a specific section about it that I've been told to cut by multiple people which I'm not going to do. But it's not incentivized terribly well. And I think many of us, you know, it's like we're not. That's not the end goal is to know, you know, do this to receive tenure. But it's it's very not helping. When you're, you know, trying to choose what to spend your time on.",113
"237","R1_2","27","27: Yeah, I will say, though, my, my college just changed our tenure guidelines, and we do have a a new part in there that talks about, you know. Please mention if you were practicing open science because we think you know, as a college, we would like to move towards open science practices. So maybe some systemic level change there from the powers that be, who, you know, dictate the tenure process would be helpful in supporting people who want to spend their time doing that to demonstrate that it's worth it.",114
"238","R1_2","F","F: Thank you very much. For just for the sake of time I'm just gonna move us on to our last couple of questions here. You all are kind of hitting on some of these things already. What impact do you think open science practices could have on the field of communication sciences and disorders? And here you might consider both research and clinical practice.",115
"239","R1_2","32","32: We have a very large research practice gap in our fields. And I think I'm under the impression, at least for my students, that they don't know that they can access AJSLP or JSLHR with their as a membership. They think they still have to like pay for individual articles. So removing that step for clinicians would be very important, I would think in improving that gap.",116
"240","R1_2","28","28: That's a really good point. I had an undergrad student who found an article by another faculty member in our department that she paid $40 to read, not realizing that she had other options so like having things open, having it clear that these things can be accessed. Having protocols available that can be implemented in clinical practice. All of these things would. I mean, presumably, lead to more research and more direct translation from the Academy to the clinic.",117
"241","R1_2","30","30: Yeah. And ideally less bias, too. Right? It's not just research coming from these huge well-funded labs, all of which tend to, I mean in the past, in CSD been funded by white males who've been in the in the field for a very long time. So I think it would be nice to just reduce the bias related to that and actually make the evidence wide reaching.",118
"242","R1_2","34","34: I agree with that 100%. Well said.",119
"243","R1_2","29","29: I think there's a lot of benefit to making raw data openly accessible in our field to back to X’s point earlier, about a lot of us have small n's and more access we have to larger data sets, we can, you know, we can ask bigger questions and make broader generalizations. And be more targeted in our research questions. And I think that's a hugely important direction for our field to take. But it. It requires our ability to access other other data sets in order to leverage that power.",120
"244","R1_2","27","27: Yeah. And I think that would facilitate the research to practice pipeline as well, because so many of our small n studies we’re like, yeah, but this is limited to this, you know, tiny subset of the population where, as if you could pull from from multiple data sets, it would be easier to generalize your findings to clinic.",121
"245","R1_2","F","F: What impact do you think open science practices could have on your own career? If any.",122
"246","R1_2","32","32: I think it would actually help recruitment. I think the more that your research seems applicable and interesting to clinicians, the more likely they are to refer to you. And if we have these kind of esoteric article titles with articles that the clinician can't access, they're not going to be very inspired to send their participants to you.",123
"247","R1_2","30","30: I've had a ton more collaboration since starting open science, because people see exactly who I work with. What the codes that we use are what people are interested in. And it's just organically made more collaborations happen for us. So that's something I've been really excited about.",124
"248","R1_2","28","28: I think, too even if the collaboration doesn't follow having more access, having more people able to access my work and having it be easily accessible has meant that my open access papers are cited more frequently than my not open access papers. Anecdotally. I haven't actually crunched those numbers, but it seems that way.",125
"249","R1_2","33","33: It seems like adding these extra steps of making what you do available to other people could improve the rigor of your own work. I mean it. It would make me think more about what I'm doing before I post this for people to see which I think is a good thing. Maybe makes us a little bit more accountable. I mean to ourselves even just right? By having, knowing that people are going to look at this.",126
"250","R1_2","F","F: Alright what did we, miss? Are there any other comments you'd like to make about using open science practices, anything related to open science? I see we're right at our time, so please, if you need to jump off, go ahead and jump off. If you have any final comments. I'm here for them if you want to share anything else related to open science. Alright. Thank you so much for your participation today. This was a fantastic discussion, and I hope that you feel like you learn something from others. I sure learned a lot from you. We hope you found this discussion really interesting, and you've shared some really valuable information with us, and we're really appreciative of your time. If you have any questions about the study after today, please feel free to send me an email.",127
"251","nonR1_1","F","F: So first, as an introduction, open science refers to a collection of research practices that aim to increase the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. So, what experiences have you had using open science practices? If any.",1
"252","nonR1_1","1","1: I guess I could start. I've done a little bit of self-archiving and keeping track of like what the rules of the different journals that I've published in are so like tracking embargo periods, and knowing what versions I can post, where. I have some on a personal website. I’m relatively new to my university. So I don't. I'm not completely aware of what kind of institutional repository options are available to me, but I have definitely used the CSDisseminate resources before. ",2
"253","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice, perfect. Any other open science practices, or a similar experience you've had within the group.",3
"254","nonR1_1","2","2: I guess I'll go I don't know if this counts. But if I have a a manuscript that was funded by NIH, and is now publicly available after the embargo period. I've been putting links to it on my faculty web page, so that if somebody was to Google or look for my article and it was behind the paywall, the journal. They at least have a link then to it, for where where you have to deposit it for NIH, so they have the publicly available copy, not the pretty journal formatted copy. So, I guess I don't know if that counts, but...",4
"255","nonR1_1","F","F: That is one form of self-archiving. Perfect, any other practices within the group?",5
"256","nonR1_1","3","3: I have been involved in groups who have posted their data on OSF. I, personally, I’m just not sure like what I’m allowed to post, since, like I have a lot of recordings of children's voices and haven't specifically asked for permission to post their voice recordings online. So, I I just feel a little bit nervous trying to figure out what I'm allowed to post and and share, and what I should keep private.",6
"257","nonR1_1","F","F: Thank you, perfect. Anyone else?",7
"258","nonR1_1","4","4: I I have provided materials online that were used in my studies for researchers or clinicians who were interested in using them, and I've also submitted data to our RHD bank. So I've done through through them. I've I I know they're still. It's not a paywall, but at least there's, it's available to a lot of researchers there.",8
"259","nonR1_1","F","F: And when you share the material as a part of the manuscript you submitted? So as a what do you call it?",9
"260","nonR1_1","4","4: Yeah. Oh, so the materials? No, I guess I have done that. I was thinking more that I'd posted them on a lab website for other people who were interested in. And I've also posted like after the fact, posters and links to like Powerpoint Presentation PDFs. After a talk I'll I'll try to post those on on my lab website as well.",10
"261","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice, thank you.",11
"262","nonR1_1","5","5: Do you include like open access journals in this? Yeah. So, I have a article published in open access journal, which was is good. That's probably my most of my experience there.",12
"263","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, that's one form of open access for sure. So gold open access. Yeah, thank you.",13
"264","nonR1_1","6","6: I'm: sorry, X. I'm Sorry.",14
"265","nonR1_1","7","7: You go. You go. ",15
"266","nonR1_1","6","6: Okay, I just wanted to say that I probably have the least experience with open science. I'm familiar with CSDisseminate. X is a friend. And so that's sort of how I came here, and I know that open science is important, and I know that open science exists. But I have not really taken the steps to do any of this myself.",16
"267","nonR1_1","F","F: Sure, thank you.",17
"268","nonR1_1","7","7: I was just gonna say I. I have just submitted my first pre-registration or report to OSF in the last year. This was my first time doing that. I'm working with a collaborator who is her job, she's like the Open Science librarian at the X, and so she's kind of walking me through all of it. And it's been an interesting experience doing this. I actually was just talking about it recently, because I'm collaborating with her, and with another researcher in our field who sort of more. It was like the kind of like the Old Guard, you know, and we're really having to stick to what we said we were going to do in terms of the analyses that we set, you know we were like we are going to do these Bayesian tests, and only when we have enough power we'll be peek at the data, and it's been an interesting experience actually having to stick to those rules and and convincing everyone on the team that right, like there's a reason that we're doing that. So yeah, this is all. This is all very like new for me. But I was excited to do this because I feel like I'm just dipping my toe into this water, and kind of like experiencing it for the first time. So yeah.",18
"269","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay nice, so pre-registration. Perfect. Thank you. I think, X, you were also going to share something. ",19
"270","nonR1_1","8","8: Yeah, I’ll jump in. I do some self-archiving. I have a website where I post all of my manuscripts. I go to the CSDisseminate website to see, you know, like which journals let you post accepted copies and etc. I post my, most of my presentation slides and posters on the same website, and then I always offer to like, my data is available upon request, and I know that that's not as good as like sharing the data publicly, and that's gonna be something I hope to do in the future. But as for now it's just like upon request.",20
"271","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. So you're still participating in practices. So, thank you for that. Okay, so I will move on to our next question. I think we covered a lot of practices. So, our next question is, what training experiences have you had? If any, about open science practices?",21
"272","nonR1_1","3","3: During my PhD, we had a weekly research meeting, and usually it was people sharing the research they were doing. But one year, one one week of the 5 years I was in my PhD someone presented on open science and recommended that we post our data onto OSF.",22
"273","nonR1_1","F","F: Was it the professor of the class, then, or a student, or?",23
"274","nonR1_1","3","3: It was a professor in the department. Yes.",24
"275","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. Anyone else?",25
"276","nonR1_1","2","2: I went to one of those zoom CSDisseminate webinars that you had. So that was helpful.",26
"277","nonR1_1","F","F: Good.",27
"278","nonR1_1","8","8: I did the same. ",28
"279","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay. ",29
"280","nonR1_1","8","8: That’s been my open science training.",30
"281","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay.",31
"282","nonR1_1","1","1: I think I have a similar experience to X, where we it was either like one class session or one colloquium meeting, and somebody presented on open science, and was like, hey, this is a good idea we should do more of this. But it wasn't particularly extensive.",32
"283","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay. So covered to some extent, part of class or through CSDisseminate. I think, X, you wanted to say something. ",33
"284","nonR1_1","6","6: Yeah, I was. I was going to jump in. Originally I was going to say, I don't think I got any training in this. But as X and X who were talking, I recall that in our systematic review class we talked about sort of the registration of a systematic review protocol. And I don't know if that would be considered open science, I think it would be. And that's basically the extent to which it was ever discussed.",34
"285","nonR1_1","F","F: Hmm. So pre-registration for scoping reviews or systematic reviews. Hmm Hmm. Perfect. ",35
"286","nonR1_1","4","4: I was gonna say I don't think I have ever attended a talk, or a webinar, or anything that was specifically about open science practices. But it's just kind of maybe thrown in like if in a presentation, or you know a talk, someone will say, well, I use you know our RHD Bank, or whatever Aphasia Bank, so you should consider that as well. I don't think I've ever had anything devoted to open science. Just kind of little bits and pieces along the way.",36
"287","nonR1_1","F","F: Thank you. Anyone else? Oh. All right. Perfect. Let's move on to our next question, then. So what open science topics would you like to learn more about? And these are some suggestions pre-registration, self-archiving gold open access, which is the one you mentioned, X, when you pay for open answers. Open data, open peer, review, open educational resources.",37
"288","nonR1_1","5","5: I would like to learn more about all of them. The open open access paper that I published was because the Autism and Developmental Language Impairments Journal was like just getting started, and they sent out a like call for papers. That was like, if you submit within this window, we'll publish it for free, and then I missed the window. So, I had to send them the email. But that's really the only reason that it is published where it's published right now. It was a good opportunity. So really learning more about what is out there would be helpful.",38
"289","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay. Nice. Thank you.",39
"290","nonR1_1","1","1: Oh, sorry. What's that? ",40
"291","nonR1_1","F","F: Go ahead.",41
"292","nonR1_1","1","1: I echo that I'd like to learn more about all of these, and especially open educational resources, are something that I know very little about, and when it comes to gold open access I'd like to learn more about funding mechanisms because to publish gold open access is just so expensive and like what what's the best way to get that money?",42
"293","nonR1_1","F","F: Perfect any other preferences or thoughts within the group?",43
"294","nonR1_1","3","3: All of them.",44
"295","nonR1_1","2","2: Yeah, sorry, all of them. Yeah.",45
"296","nonR1_1","3","3: I just am like nervous to venture too far into self-archiving and open data, because I'm just not sure what I'm legally allowed to do.",46
"297","nonR1_1","F","F: So if you were to choose one...Is there others that you are more interested in then?",47
"298","nonR1_1","3","3: I don't even know what open educational resources means. But I'm so interested by the name.",48
"299","nonR1_1","6","6: I would I would agree with everybody who is saying all of them. But I know that open educational resources is a really big push at my institution, because we are in sort of a lower SES area that people are really looking at the cost of attendance sort of beyond that, and trying to use as many open educational resources as possible. So I would say that that is definitely an area. If I had to pick one that would probably be the one that would be most relevant to my everyday life.",49
"300","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. Thank you.",50
"301","nonR1_1","2","2: Yeah, same. We're, there's a really big push at my university now, where I'm I got on some task force too for open educational resources. But it would like to know more about our discipline specific and just not finding a lot out there, and I guess, in terms of open data and how to work with your IRB on that specifically.",51
"302","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. Any other thoughts?",52
"303","nonR1_1","7","7: Yeah, I was just gonna jump off of what X said about. I've also been looking into open education resources. I teach phonetics, and I was like, oh, yeah, there's going to be tons of stuff out there, and the there is not as far...Yeah, right? So I guess I want to learn about finding resources and also about making resources. Like maybe about like networking with people and figuring out, wait like, how do we create that stuff so we can share? For our discipline. You know, for our classes.",53
"304","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. Yeah.",54
"305","nonR1_1","8","8: I'll go ahead and echo All of these calls for open educational resources, and to a lesser extent like open access journals. I agree with all of that. But I would also like to single out pre-registration. I feel like I just missed that my doc program. And now that I've gone through and you know, graduated, I just. I don't know how to learn how to preregister things, and I feel like that's a a big gap in my personal knowledge.",55
"306","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay, thank you. Yeah.",56
"307","nonR1_1","7","7: I don't think you missed it. I don't think it was there. I'm just gonna tell you like I don't think, yeah, I just don't think it was there. I yeah, I feel really lucky that I have this person. That's the only reason I'm doing it. And she's been like walking me through it. But I felt the same as you. I don't know that I would have done it on my own, because it felt like I was completely, well I was completely naive to what was supposed to go in there. And you know what are my goals from doing it? So yeah, I would like to learn more about it, too, so I can feel more confident about doing it myself.",57
"308","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, it sounds like. Sorry.",58
"309","nonR1_1","1","1: Sorry. I feel like I don't know what to pre-register like I feel like my studies aren't big enough for important enough or using the right methods to preregister.",59
"310","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay. So also pre-registration, but like what to pre-register exactly. I think there's still X. Or would you like to share or we can move to? Yeah, the next question.",60
"311","nonR1_1","4","4: I think that pre-registration and open educational resources would be the ones I'd be really most most interested in. But I think I agree also that they're all...I could probably use information about all of them. But if I had to pick, you know, a couple of those would be the two I would pick.",61
"312","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay, perfect. I will move to our next question just for the sake of time. So how would you prefer to learn about these practices? So live prerecording webinars, interactive workshops, handouts, Youtube videos, or any other thing that wasn't mentioned?",62
"313","nonR1_1","1","1: The shorter the better. Handouts, a simple Youtube video. Like 10 min tops. To like keep it short and easy to fit into my life.",63
"314","nonR1_1","F","F: Perfect. So something straightforward. Okay.",64
"315","nonR1_1","5","5: Something that I can return to also, like short. But also I can have access to it all the time. Be helpful. ",65
"316","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay.",66
"317","nonR1_1","8","8: I was thinking handouts and Youtube videos for the same reason. You know something I can do on my own time.",67
"318","nonR1_1","F","F: Hmm. Hmm.",68
"319","nonR1_1","7","7: Okay, I'm going to be Devil's advocate and say that I would like I would like something interactive, because sometimes I feel like...I don't know. I like when I look things up online, maybe my question is so so back, you know, like I'm, I'm. So I'm so novel. It's so new to me, or I'm such a you know I'm such a novice that, like I need to be able to ask questions to make sure I understand what we're talking about, and sometimes it's not. You know I'm basically I'm not gonna find the Youtube video that's gonna get me to the basic level that I need to be at. So I don't know. I also. I would like both. You know what I mean. I would like to attend something interactive where I can ask questions and then have things that I can return to later, you know, look-upable things are useful too.",69
"320","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, or like a recording of the Webinar or something. Yeah, yeah.",70
"321","nonR1_1","2","2: Yeah, I I feel like that too. I need something interactive. Or I need like a working group where I'm accountable. Youtube is not gonna hold me accountable to like that open access, resource or something. So I do like something interactive. Or you're willing. I don't know if there was anything at ASHA. But if there was something that could be presented at conferences too.",71
"322","nonR1_1","F","F: As in a conference presentation, something like that?",72
"323","nonR1_1","2","2: Yeah.",73
"324","nonR1_1","F","F: And for the working group, would that be something kind of like on slack or something like that?",74
"325","nonR1_1","2","2: Yeah, I don't know. But something that I I think I do like the interactive more than if I If I feel like if I had it on Youtube like I would maybe try to fit it in, but it's always like I'll get to it versus like I have to be there at 7 o'clock.",75
"326","nonR1_1","F","F: Sure. Like the accountability piece.",76
"327","nonR1_1","4","4: I was. I also agree that I think having the handouts, and everything is is great to have. But also, if there can be, you know, presentations at conferences. That's nice, because I've already carved out time to attend, and it would be a topic I would be interested in. And even like a website. That would kind of be a resource for for a lot of these things. I don't know how possible that is, and who would fund it, etc., but something like that would be really good for you, because it could be constantly updated. It'd be one place to go to reach a lot of resources, you know. So, I think that those would all be great if they were if they were available.",77
"328","nonR1_1","6","6: I I agree with everything that everybody has said, and I understand that they're different, but I think they all have value, and I think they all add value. But I was thinking sort of along the lines of we've talked about interactive workshops and in the interactive workshop I might think of questions. But what happens to me more often is I get really excited about something, and then I'll go back to do it and be like. Oh. I don't remember how to do this, and it's not very clear on the handout, so I have no idea if this is feasible. But if a group like CSDisseminate, or something like that had like a contact person like. If there were a person that you could reach out to with a question. I have no idea about the feasibility of any of that, but that would be really cool to have a workshop, and then have somebody that if something came up. You know who to ask and who to contact.",78
"329","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, yeah. Any other thoughts before I move to our next question? All right. So our our next question our next section too. We will be talking about four different open science practices in more detail. So the first one is pre-registration, and I was already mentioned, but I'll describe briefly. So it's the process of hosting an outline of for a proposed research project on a pre-registration repository, such as open science framework before data collection or analysis. They typically include written research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. So, what do you perceive to be the barriers to preregistering your own studies?",79
"330","nonR1_1","1","1: Not knowing where to preregister them is one. And concern that my methods and analysis plan will need to shift between preregistration and publication.",80
"331","nonR1_1","2","2: For me it's time. I'm I have a pretty large teaching load, and it's for me sometimes it's like it's one more thing, and if I put something out there, someone I so right now I teach a 3-3 in the fall, because I just got tenured. I will now teach a 4-4, and when I put something out there a a big lab could could do that. Would I what's gonna take me as somebody with a big teaching load with a 4-4 is gonna take me over a year. Somebody's got a lot of resources. It's gonna take them a couple of months, and for me sometimes it's just it's that was my idea, and not that I'm i'm scared of being beings scooped, or whatever. But it's the fact that I don't have as much time and resources, being someone with a high teaching load at a very teaching focused university. So that's that's part of it is the the time factor, and that that concern to be honest.",81
"332","nonR1_1","F","F: Thank you.",82
"333","nonR1_1","6","6: I also teach a 4-4, or I do teach a 4-4, and I feel like I have enough time. I have a really tough time carving out time for research as it is. So adding an additional step to the research processes like I said, it's going to make it less likely that things get done, and I'm having enough of a tough time getting things done, as it is. Also, sorry I didn't mean to cut somebody off. I just maybe I just have imposter syndrome or something, but I also don't feel very confident in develop...I obviously I have a PhD. Like, I know how to sort of develop research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. But I I again feel very anxious putting it out there for everybody else, especially like before I'm finished with it, because I feel like I might have missed something, or it just gives me a little bit of anxiety because I still don't feel super confident.",83
"334","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, especially it hasn't gone through peer review yet, and you haven't like it. You're still developing it. I could see that. Yeah, yeah.",84
"335","nonR1_1","8","8: Kind of agree with that that. That really resonated with me. X, you're probably a better researcher than I am. You know I just. I defended my dissertation a year ago. For me research is still a learning process, and without being the most recent big research that I did. My methods changed mid-dissertation. My analysis plan changed mid-dissertation. I know that's poor quality, because, you know, obviously I should have all of that outlined ahead of time, and I should be held accountable to following those, you know, procedures. But I just still feel like, hey, I'm a lousy researcher. My plan A probably isn't going to work out. You know. How do I shift away from something if it's preregistered and written in stone?",85
"336","nonR1_1","7","7: I guess I feel like I'm always going to say something controversial. I I I guess, like I would. What everyone saying is making me realize that I think the biggest barriers is that we just aren't used to doing it. We don't know what we're doing, and we haven't been trained to do this this isn't how we've been taught to do research our entire, like. I think I'm kind of maybe on on the older end like I finished my, I started my PhD in 2006. I won't say when I finished it, but because it was a long time. But you know this wasn't how we did research. What we did is, we would kind of come up with our analysis plans, you know, as we're going along. And and you know which is yeah, maybe that's not what we're supposed to do, but that's kind of how I was trained to do it, you know, and it was like, oh, let's do a post. We even called a post hoc. It's like, oh, this correlation looks interesting. Let's see right? So there's something kind of scary about coming up with an analysis plan and sticking to it ahead of time. And like I said, I'm doing this for the first time right now. And it is it's interesting how I'm working with these two people, and I have one person who is not comfortable sticking to what we said we are going to do, and this is a very famous person in our field who is very well established. But this is just like not what we've been, how we've been trained, you guys, and so it's not that we're bad researchers, or you know that are stuff is not important enough. I was thinking about what you're talking about with time time, X, cause theoretically, this saves us time right, because, like you, you know, like you come up with what you're going to do, and you know.",86
"337","nonR1_1","2","2: It should!",87
"338","nonR1_1","7","7: Right, it should. It's just this is so antithetical to how we've been doing research forever. I think that's what I feel like is the big barrier, you know.",88
"339","nonR1_1","F","F: That's a good point. Thank you. I will move to our next question just for the sake of time. We have 15 questions. I want to make sure we can get through most of them. So our next question is about self- archiving. I know you also mentioned this as a group, and I'll do a brief introduction, so it involves making a version of the manuscript legally and freely available on a lab website, personal website, or repository. So what do you perceive to be the barriers of self-archiving your work?",89
"340","nonR1_1","5","5: I think the biggest one is just knowing like when it's allowed. If you know, if it's not really clear in the journal if that's okay, then that's the biggest barrier for me.",90
"341","nonR1_1","4","4: I agree. I'm. I'm nervous about it. So, for example, on Research Gate, I I will if someone messages me asking for a copy, I always send it to them, but I don't make it publicly available just because I don't want. I don't know if journals are on Research Gate looking for academics to sue or whatever. But I don't want to find out. So that I think just the fact that each journal has very specific requirements makes me nervous. So I think I'm comfortable sharing the the Pub Med, you know version, if that's available, for if it was an NIH funded study, but otherwise I I am a little...makes me nervous.",91
"342","nonR1_1","8","8: I do a lot of work as second author and third author, and that kind of thing. So I you know I need to get consent from the other authors. At least I feel like. But then often I'm depending on them to send me the accepted manuscript. And either they don't get around to it, or don't feel like it, or they're not on board, so that's been a barrier that I've encountered.",92
"343","nonR1_1","6","6: I don't really, it's just, it's not a problem. I just have...I don't have a really. We don't have a really robust lab website. I don't have a personal website, so it just seems like there's multiple steps that even if I got something published which I don't have many publications. So that's part one is the issue that again, the time to have manuscripts that I can publish and self- archive. But then the process of like creating the the website or the repository, or wherever it's going to be. It just seems like there's multiple steps, and none of them are pressing, and I don't know about anybody else, but I really respond well to deadlines and pressure, and so this never has a deadline or pressure, so it's never at the top of my list.",93
"344","nonR1_1","F","F: X, did you have anything about self- archiving?",94
"345","nonR1_1","3","3: No, just I I don't know what I'm allowed to do, and I like...every journal has different rules, so it's not even like I can just say like, oh, I'm allowed to do X. Because ASHA has a different rule compared to you know, Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, and I just. I just don't wanna get sued for sharing my own work that I that I worked on it's a little bit ridiculous that we're not allowed to share our own work. ",95
"346","nonR1_1","F","F: Perfect. I think I skipped off factors that facilitate your ability to pre-register studies so I’ll shift gears, I think a little, and then we can go back to self-archiving. So so just so that I don't forget. If there are any also.",96
"347","nonR1_1","4","4: If there is just a one place, I could go and look up the journal, and it would just say what their policy was that would help.",97
"348","nonR1_1","F","F: So for self- archiving. I know I...we're okay. Let's stick to what facilitates self-archiving and then I'll jump back to the pre-registration. So yeah, what helps you self-archive? So the website was one. Anything else? There can be none.",98
"349","nonR1_1","3","3: I mean the like. If there were a handout saying like, you know, I think I think someone just said this, but like the journal name, what I am allowed to do legally and just someone explain it to me, and just very easy to understand language that I can be sure I'm not breaking some copyright.",99
"350","nonR1_1","F","F: Anything else?",100
"351","nonR1_1","1","1: It would be nice if journals made that information, like every journal has their policy on it, and you can find it. But it's so many steps, and like clicking and digging through everything and it I I mean, I imagine that facilitating self-archiving is not the priority of most for-profit publishers but it would be awfully nice.",101
"352","nonR1_1","F","F: Perfect. Yeah. Okay. So I'll jump back to our preregistration. Did anyone have anything that helps them preregister? I know, X, you said, you have that person. Anyone else has anything that helps them pre-register? And if not, that's okay, too.",102
"353","nonR1_1","3","3: Yeah I mean, it goes back to what someone is saying about like you're not sure what you're gonna do with the stats like. You might make some statistical decision, and it's not the right one. And so like, even like I feel like if I already have my data, I feel much more confident about my stats plan. Then, like if I'm hoping to collect some amount of data. So like, really, where I am in the process, like if I pre-register something, hoping that I'll be able to get, you know, 120 kids, but I only get 60 like that. Like I'm not going to be able to do the same statistical analyses all the time, so like. I think it just depends on where I am in the process of data collection, and like preregistering before I even collect any data. I'm not sure I I want to maintain that that same approach after I get the data.",103
"354","nonR1_1","7","7: I just want to add from one thing X said, I know we need to move on. But yeah, just that I think I'm. Something that would help facilitate for me is is what you're allowed to say in terms of exploratory or like, you know this is like, is it a flow...Can I put a flow chart like if I have this many kids? This is what I'll do. But if I have this many, you know what I mean, and and there are things you can do like you are allowed to say those things. Like this is what I would do in this event. But if this doesn't happen, but I but if you haven't so again like what would facilitate it would be like training. I just need to learn what's allowed. I need to learn what you can say, you know, and I just again. I don't think many of us have had that training.",104
"355","nonR1_1","1","1: And I also just want to add on really quickly, because I hear everybody talking about their statistical analysis plans, and I do a lot of qualitative work, and, like your research questions can change once you have started analysis, so I feel like the rules become even less clear, and that makes it harder to preregister qualitative studies.",105
"356","nonR1_1","4","4: I think I would be more like oh, go ahead! Did you want to move on? ",106
"357","nonR1_1","F","F: I'll let you. I'll end this one with you, and then we'll move to the next.",107
"358","nonR1_1","4","4: Ok, I was just gonna say I think I often do is I keep doing studies that are quite different from ones I've done previously, which is, I suppose, good on some levels, but on an another, I think if I was doing a study that was very similar with similar methods. Similar population. You know, and I knew kind of I could kind of predict like, yes, I'll easily be able to get these participants, and so on. I think I'd be more likely if it was just really similar to something I'd done previously. I'd be more likely to be comfortable pre-registering something just kind of having walked through the analysis, having some knowledge of what you know that I've gotten through those barriers that would be concerning. And I I wonder if it's something I would be more likely to do in the future, just because, as I get more comfortable with, if I ever stop doing studies that are totally different, take more time than they should, because I insist on doing something else. I don't know.",108
"359","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay, yeah. So like familiarity and training and doing it more, will make it easier, makes sense. Yeah. Our next practice would be gold open access. So this is when you pay a fee to publishers to make an article available for others to read for free. So what are barriers to publishing open access for you? Money. I see a lot of nods, too. So I think that's echoed by maybe all of you?",109
"360","nonR1_1","8","8: Money is really the only barrier. As far as I can tell.",110
"361","nonR1_1","4","4: My post doc advisor. She never wanted to pay open access fees because we always had to submit everything to to NIH eventually, anyway. So she thought like, why would we spend our money on this when eventually it will be public? So I mean, that was kind of like you're going to do it, anyway. So why are we going to pay $4,000 to do it now?",111
"362","nonR1_1","F","F: So thinking more about the resources and not like keeping maybe the grant money for something else. Okay. Anything else other than money?",112
"363","nonR1_1","5","5: This is probably a really naive question. But what is the difference between what makes it gold open access as compared to other levels?",113
"364","nonR1_1","F","F: Yeah, that's a good question. No. So you pay a fee for the publisher, and it becomes immediately open access as soon as you publish it, and you also own the copyrights to it wherever as when you publish it, kind of like, when what your X mentioned through NIH. So it gets published openly after a certain embargo period. So this is not considered gold open access. So basically paying a lot of money to get it published open access as soon as possible. ",114
"365","nonR1_1","5","5: Thanks. I knew the money was an issue. I just didn't know the difference. ",115
"366","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay, perfect. I think we had a lot of agreement on this one, either way. Is there anything that facilitates your ability to publish gold open access so something that helps you do that, or could help you do that in the future.",116
"367","nonR1_1","5 ","5 : I I tried to write. Oh, sorry X. I just. I tried to write funds for open access, publishing into my startup, and I was denied so. But I guess that would be a barrier, but it would have helped. So.",117
"368","nonR1_1","F","F: Makes sense either way. Yeah, X.",118
"369","nonR1_1","4","4: Yeah, I was just gonna say that a couple of times where I'm faculty now and then where I did my postdoc. They, the libraries of those institutions, promoted a deal that they had with a specific publisher, where they were for a certain period of time gonna offer free open access. And I certainly took advantage of that. And specifically, you know, went and picked a journal that was within that publishing suite. So that was great because it was free. But it was that was offered through the institution, and I have no idea like what on the back end was happening, but the library promoted it, and both cases, and I took advantage of it.",119
"370","nonR1_1","8","8: I'll just throw this out there. I'm realistic about my lot in life. I work at a teaching school. Open access fees...The gold open access fees cost more than I'm allotted for research each year. I don't care that much about impact factors. I just want my words on paper. I don't need to submit to the top tier journals. I would be happy submitting to like the open access, CSD journal, if somebody would, you know, peer review and publish my work and share it with a, you know, students and faculty in our field across the country, and wherever.",120
"371","nonR1_1","F","F: So you adopt for kind of a different route of open access for, and it doesn't have to be gold open access then.",121
"372","nonR1_1","4","4: Okay, Sorry. I keep interrupting people. I was just gonna say, my dean at my current institution did advertise that she was also willing in some cases to pay open access fees so to contact her if you had a journal where that would be appropriate, and she would consider it depending on I assuming impact factor, and so on. But that was something I I don't know if that's common, but I was surprised to hear it.",122
"373","nonR1_1","F","F: Any other thoughts? Alrighty. Our last open science practice will be open data. So open data is the process of publicly sharing research data or resources needed for data collection, such as methodology, protocols, or software packages. It is typically made available on online repositories, so such as the open science framework and others that you've mentioned so far. What do you perceive to be barriers to the open data process?",123
"374","nonR1_1","6","6: I can just talk about one specific barrier that I've experienced, which is, I am my dissertation, study, or part of my dissertation study was a replication of somebody else's work with a slightly different population and slightly different methods. And so, when I wanted to share some of those methods, they were still under copyright from their from their published work, they they had given them to me so that I could use them. But I couldn't share them sort of openly and publicly. So that was a barrier that I've experienced.",124
"375","nonR1_1","3","3: My IRB is not willing to let me put anything online like I've I've asked their permission to put things on on like the childes database website, and they refuse.",125
"376","nonR1_1","F","F: Okay. IRB.",126
"377","nonR1_1","1","1: Somebody earlier mentioned participant consent. Which I think, as as I grow as a researcher and my awareness of open science practices, grows. I'm starting to build that into consent processes. But you know, for studies that have already been done like you can't retroactively do it, so that I think just getting participant consent, and having the mechanisms in place to do it can be potentially a barrier.",127
"378","nonR1_1","4","4: Sometimes I work with pretty specialized patient populations, and when the study has a low n it would make me really nervous to share like lesion data and like it would. It would be that almost to the point where you could potentially figure out who they are, if you know where the study was conducted, and kind of some of the specifics of their disease, so I that would make that makes me nervous, especially with the low n.",128
"379","nonR1_1","F","F: Sure, yes, like it's too much identifying information if it's shared then.",129
"380","nonR1_1","8","8: I do a lot of mixed methods work, and especially in the qualitative portion. I'm worried about that as well. I'm worried that you know the more my participants share, the harder it's going to be to completely de-identify them, and I don't want my participants to have to worry about you know, the what they share in the interview. I don't want them to have to be concerned about like over-sharing or giving me too much information.",130
"381","nonR1_1","F","F: Ok. What do you think there are any factors that currently facilitate your ability to use open data or could facilitate your ability to do that in the future? I’ll call them. Yeah. ",131
"382","nonR1_1","1","1: This is. I wonder if this is another place where library assistance could help? Like if university libraries had open data, repositories and we didn't have to like, find one. I don't. I don't know if that would be useful.",132
"383","nonR1_1","3","3: Well, I think the NIH is changing to require data sharing, so I think that'll be a good facilitator. Anyone who has funding will be forced to.",133
"384","nonR1_1","F","F: The policy, ok. I'll call on X. Any thoughts on that?",134
"385","nonR1_1","5","5: I was trying to decide how to frame it as a facilitator but I just I don't know if there is a way to like. So our IRB here thinks that audio recordings, and I don't know how true this is for other places, but those are identifiable, especially with the low n like X was saying. So like if there was a way to further de-identify the voices that were...so that it would be less identifiable. Maybe that would be something that would facilitate open data sharing.",135
"386","nonR1_1","F","F: Any other thoughts that haven't been mentioned?",136
"387","nonR1_1","4","4: I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do, like if there's if if it was someone's job to do it, that would be...And making sure it's de-identified, and you know, like the stress was making sure everything's de-identified, taking the time to do that on top of everything else we have to do is faculty, I think. I mean, I think time is a big barrier too with anything that's not required it. It gets pushed and pushed and pushed with everything else that you have to do kind of prioritized.",137
"388","nonR1_1","7","7: Yeah, I agree, I X. I don't know if you know I I was trying this whole time. I've been trying to remember there is an autism repository that I I think you're required to. Yeah. The NIH requires that you any data you collect you have to like, put it in this repository. And as part of my postdoc, like I had, I was the one who had to format the data for that thing. And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then. But I would. That is a barrier to me right now. I like would never want to do that again, because you know it, it was just who's going to do that? It took so much time. So yeah, time is a huge one, and with all the and then what I'll just say, I think, like a theme that's coming out of this just like the archiving thing is people are feeling like they don't know what's allowed, and I think, like straightforward like, what are the things that we're allowed to to to archive or not like, you know what counts as the de-identifiable or not like. And if that's straightforward across institutions? Which it sounds like, it's not so yeah.",138
"389","nonR1_1","F","F: Clear rules and expectations so that everyone can know what's allowed and what's not. Yeah. Okay. So back to like more big picture questions and not specific practices. So, what impact do you think open science practices could have on the field of communication sciences and disorders? And you could think of both research and clinical practice.",139
"390","nonR1_1","1","1: Reduce the research-to-practice gap! Get it out there faster.",140
"391","nonR1_1","F","F: Yes. X agrees too.",141
"392","nonR1_1","3","3: I, you know, like I use some some researchers who have put their their research data on online as a teaching tool like for case studies. So you know, it gives me access to better better teaching cases. And I think that also helps again reduce that research-to-practice gap because the students are are practicing with real real cases.",142
"393","nonR1_1","4","4: On the research side, it would make, you know, meta analyses easier to do, which maybe help us kind of answer some of those questions that are harder to answer with, like the smaller n. And once you've combined a lot of studies together maybe we can start getting your clearer answers to some of the questions that would help clinicians.",143
"394","nonR1_1","5","5: Replication from different labs to see if the things are actually working, or if it's a researcher influence.",144
"395","nonR1_1","8","8: Open data would facilitate secondary data analyses which would make life a lot easier for those of us that aren’t in R1or R2 institutions if we didn't have to collect our own data.",145
"396","nonR1_1","6","6: Yeah, access to participants is really challenging for those of us especially like I, said a teacher. I it's come up a lot. I teach a 4-4 load. I feel like I am barely keeping my head above water like just teaching my classes. So again, collecting data from real life people and coordinating that with my schedule is a nightmare. So second, being able to do research that is, secondary data analysis would be really helpful for me to grow as professional and to, you know, make tenure, and all of those types of things.",146
"397","nonR1_1","F","F: Nice. X, what do you think?",147
"398","nonR1_1","7","7: Yeah, I mean, everyone’s saying good stuff. I think it's I I yeah, I like, I think this point about especially for clinical research about you know it. People looking at like a small n like X was saying, you know, and and being able to see that across studies, and seeing, oh, this is a consistent finding, especially like clinical finding. This is a consistent clinical finding. Or it's not, would be huge. I I was having this weird thought, too, though that, like this, is a totally different way of thinking about open science. But some sometimes I feel like communication sciences and disorders were sort of like, I don't know it would legitimize us, I guess. A little bit too like in the field of science, like you know what I mean I sometimes it feels like we're a little slower to jump on these on this stuff like here's where science is headed, and here's where we are, and you know, so I think if we were part of that like it would make people recognize this field as a scientific field of study, you know. So I don't know if that's an okay thing to say. But it was something that I was thinking as I was considering this question.",148
"399","nonR1_1","F","F: Everything is okay to say here. So. ",149
"400","nonR1_1","7","7: Thanks.",150
"401","nonR1_1","F","F: Yes, okay. I think I covered everyone for this question. Our next question, yeah. What impact do you think they could have on your career, and I know this kind of connects to the question before, but feel free to like to elaborate or add to that, too.",151
"402","nonR1_1","1","1: I liked what X said earlier about it would make it easier for some of us to get tenure.",152
"403","nonR1_1","5","5: Especially like X was saying too if I didn't have to conduct a research study every time I needed to publish something. I'm interested in intervention research which takes, you know, a long time to get going, and then maybe I'll get a couple of pubs, but like in the meantime, I have 5 years of work that I have to have publications, and that process can be pretty slow. So if there was a way to access other data or make these connections with secondary analyses, maybe that would be something I could be doing while I was recruiting and and treating participants. So...maybe not early tenure, but at least tenure.",153
"404","nonR1_1","8","8: I mean, I think I’d publish more with open data. I think I'd probably get more citations with open access to my articles, at least, from what I've heard. This might be tangential to your point. If we went back to open educational research resources, I’d probably have more time to conduct research if there were open education resources available.",154
"405","nonR1_1","7","7: Yeah, I just wanna the the the audience thing is huge. I mean, you're gonna like, you know, publishing open access just by definition means that you have a bigger audience and sharing your data with like lots of researchers is really exciting, because I was thinking about like an audience in terms of readership, but also in terms of collaborations. You know, like you'd be a way to find out what other people are doing, and vice versa for them to find out what I'm doing, and so that would be really exciting.",155
"406","nonR1_1","1","1: I think there's potential impacts with like participants and the communities that we're working with like. If your work is more readily accessible to the people who are directly affected by it, then that influences their perception of you, which influences their willingness to support your future research.",156
"407","nonR1_1","F","F: Perfect. I think we're doing great on time. And we actually got to our last question. So this is where you could basically elaborate anything. So did we miss anything? Are there any comments you would like to make about using open science practices or anything you'd like to, yeah, elaborate on.",157
"408","nonR1_1","6","6: Open peer review was in that section of like what are things that we want to learn about? I have never heard of that in my life. So I would, I know that we sort of said all of them, but I and it didn't come up in our sort of questions today, but that would be something I'd be interested in like learning more about. And are there journals in our field that do this? I don't know.",158
"409","nonR1_1","4","4: I was asked to be a reviewer on an open review, and it was for a researcher who I deeply respected, but who scared me, and I decided I did not want to do it, because I didn't want her to, you know, even though I’m sure the review would have been pretty positive. I just didn't want her to associate me with criticizing her work. Granted, she was very senior, and I was a postdoc at the time. I think it was Frontiers. I think a lot of those journals are open. I could be wrong, but I think a lot of those journals have. Oh, my God...they...",159
"410","nonR1_1","F","F: Like open peer review?",160
"411","nonR1_1","4","4: Yes, thank you. Yeah, yeah.",161
"412","nonR1_1","7","7: That’s what it is. I wanted to know this whole time it's it's so. It's just not blinded. So everyone knows who's saying, what about stuff? Oh. whoa!",162
"413","nonR1_1","3","3: I Also I I keep thinking we need. I mean this isn't quite open research, but I I think we need like a repository of lectures and lecture activities and case studies for for, like our field’s teaching, sharing the teaching prep load would be very helpful, and giving me more time for for research, and make my teaching more effective.",163
"414","nonR1_1","4","4: Sharing assignments on canvas too would be really nice to be able to just have...I don't know, like this one canvas for CSD, where you can pull assignments into your course that are already, you know. I don't know if that again maybe not possible. But that would be really nice.",164
"415","nonR1_1","F","F: X and X any final thoughts, too, as we wrap up.",165
"416","nonR1_1","8","8: Just been, you know, nodding my head vigorously to everything everyone said. I really wish and hope somebody will go off and get the resources to like build a website where maybe we can sort all of of our instructional, like assignments and syllabi and slides, and all of those things to make the the teaching part more open. And then, as I was listening to the discussion of, like the the open reviews, I love the idea of transparency, especially like for for making people accountable for some of the the harmful and abusive and uninformed things that they say. But also there's just this huge power differential there. And I wouldn't be able to review for some of the people that I review for, if they knew it was me reviewing for them.",166
"417","nonR1_1","5","5: I totally agree. I think the ability to hide behind a screen it makes everybody say a lot of things that they wouldn't, maybe otherwise. I do think though, as this open science movement seems to be gaining some traction, and we're seeing some keyboard warriors. Yeah, seeing some like more focus on this, I feel like, and I don't know if it's just because I'm new. But I feel like we are...I've noticed that, like people in this kind of generation are more likely to also share the teaching things like I've had several people just offer me materials, and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I can't. This is so wonderful, you know, and I have been surprised by that, because I feel like before, or at least my impression of what academia is is like research, and your teaching stuff is like yours and yours only, and we don't share. And so I'm hoping maybe we'll see some carry-over into all of the areas of academia. If we just...we just all have to keep working together!",167
"418","nonR1_1","F","F: I think that's a beautiful note to end with, for today I really enjoyed our discussion. Thank you so much for your time and for showing up. I'll do just a quick shout out, I think, to OpenCSD. It's a new group that's also focusing on open science. It's a sister group for CSDisseminate, and we've been doing a journal club on open science. So, if that's something you're interested in. That's a space where we're trying to learn about open science together. But other than that, thank you so much. You can look it up online, and we do have a website, and there is a...",168
"419","nonR1_2","F","F: So our first question open science refers to a collection of research practices that aim to increase the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. What experience have you had using open science practices? If any.",1
"420","nonR1_2","17","17: I'll go ahead and start?",2
"421","nonR1_2","F","F: Yes, please do.",3
"422","nonR1_2","17","17: So I don't know necessarily that I've had any experience with using open science practices. I have attended continuing education sessions on how to access research more easily, and to avoid paying for articles and getting around paywalls. But other than that, I haven't really had much opportunity.",4
"423","nonR1_2","10","10: I would second that I would say. During my training, and even through, I would say, local continuing education at my university. I have not had much experience with open science practices. However, I, you know, as a scientist myself. I am trying to be more transparent about my work, and like using like posting protocols and trying to publish open access when possible. And then sharing data is a little more complicated, I would say, from my perspective.",5
"424","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. I see X has their hand raised. You wanted to share?",6
"425","nonR1_2","11","11: I wanted to add. So I work at a university, and our library, our librarians are very active in increasing...sorry my cat...open access, so they do a lot of training. We have an open access publication fund that was supported by the librarians. And so there's money that researchers can apply for to support open acc...to cover the open access fees for publishing in an open access journal. They also have some. The University has some relationships, I guess, with Elsevier, or other things where we can also publish in certain journals. We can publish in a non- open access journal, but cover the open access fees through that.  And we also have a Scholar Works which is the institutional repository. So when...and I don't know that that's really caught on super widely in the university. But they are trying to do a lot to get the word out that when when researchers, you know whether they be faculty, staff, lecturors at the university publish, they can put them in that repository, and then they're available to people within institution, which, as in, as I understand, is a little more. You know, you can do that before you before the embargo date, since it's not technically public.",7
"426","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah. Thank you for sharing. Does anyone else have anything to add to any of that?",8
"427","nonR1_2","12","12: Yeah, i'll go ahead if that's okay. Let's see. I haven't done a whole lot related to open science exactly. I've listened to several different podcasts talking about the various aspects of open science, so I feel like I have a decent understanding of the different components of it. But haven't implemented. Let's see, like I haven't posted data publicly before, code or published anything, paid extra to publish open access, or done any registered reports or anything. Let's see. I tried to put up free, legal versions of previous manuscripts on my department website, but was told that I had to adhere to a particular format that didn't allow for publications to be posted on there. So, as it turns out, I wasn't able to. But I respond quickly to requests on Research Gate. When people do request articles.",9
"428","nonR1_2","13","13: I'll answer that as well. So, I have tried to post anything I can on my research gate. I don't have a personal website yet, but I have posted preregistrations on OSF and I've posted some R scripts and some stimuli. I haven't shared data yet. But have been paying for open access and things like that as well.",10
"429","nonR1_2","14","14: Okay, I'll explain. So yeah, I have published in open science journals and uploaded my papers on Bio archive for public accessibility. I have only heard positive responses from people who have downloaded them and had access to the manuscripts. I've also uploaded stimuli and experiment protocols on Github.  And I do agree with the statement I see here is that it increases the accessibility, transfer, and replicability of science.",11
"430","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, thank you for sharing everyone so. And this is like kind of a part to that question. But the next question I have is what training experience have you had, if any, about open science practices?",12
"431","nonR1_2","15","15: Can I start?",13
"432","nonR1_2","F","F: Sure.",14
"433","nonR1_2","15","15: All right. So I did do a CSDisseminate webinar, maybe. But most of my open science practice knowledge was built individually through conversations with other scientists who were working their way through the process. Or recommended like a research gate for sending articles, or walked me through which exact manuscript draft it was the one to save that could be legally shared. Yeah. and you say it. It's a lot of individual instruction at the beginning.",15
"434","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. Does anyone have any other experiences or anything else they want to share?",16
"435","nonR1_2","12","12: I'll go ahead and add to that. Similarly, I think I did a CSDisseminate something a webinar, whatever it was some time ago, but otherwise I I mean, I've had very little formal instruction on open science. It wasn't really a model that was emphasized in my Phd training. I didn't really see that from my Phd mentors. A little bit of OSF. Posting some stimuli there. But it wasn't really emphasized or not right, encouraged very much. So otherwise. Yeah. What, a Webinar here, there, some podcasts, and then seeing things on Twitter. People encouraging open science practices.",17
"436","nonR1_2","13","13: I'll also add, so I didn't do a postdoc. I went straight from a Ph.D. right into an assistant professor position, and I feel like the friends that I have that are currently in postdocs or just wrapping up have been able to get that training, so I feel like it's blossoming right now and some of us that have graduated, you know, 4 5 6 years ago. Kind of missed the train a little bit on all that training that's coming out. So, someone that I've recently collaborated with that is a postdoc has actually taught me quite a bit, and that's how I've gotten kind of more exposure and comfort with OSF and pre registrations and posting things like that. So? I would agree with X if I'm pronouncing your name correctly? In that it's been a lot of like one-on-one individualized kind of support from colleagues.",18
"437","nonR1_2","14","14: Yeah, I added, I attended a training session at a conference. It was a formal training session. Yeah, you know, IHCON at Lake Tahoe. I I attended that conference there was a discussion and the need for open access and all that. So, I I receive formal training during a postdoctal experience.",19
"438","nonR1_2","16","16: Hmm. Is it? Okay, if I go?",20
"439","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, of course.",21
"440","nonR1_2","16","16: So, I'm: in a slightly different position in that I am in an acting assistant professor role, but also currently completing my PhD. So, I'm doing both at once. And we, in my PhD program, we haven't talked about open science practices, and it was more my experience with it, is more from when I was wrapping up my clinical practice kind of phase of my career, and where I was sort of reading about, and hearing that this was a way that as a consumer I could sort of get that information. And I have not had much about being like much training about being a producer of science, and how to get that out. There was more about like this is how you can access it when you need it. Not how you get it out.",22
"441","nonR1_2","17","17: Yeah. So similar to another participant, I did not complete a postdoc. I got my EdD which was much more focused on teaching than research, although we did have a research component. And yeah. And then I went straight into a teaching position. So my university library has talked about open education resources, but because my university is not a research focused university, I don't think open access for research is as much of a concern. Especially because our tenure and promotion expectations are going to be lower because we're not a research focused institution.",23
"442","nonR1_2","F","F: I see. Thank you for sharing. Just for the sake of time, going on to the next question. What open science topics would you like to learn more about? And I do have some topics listed here just for your reference. Who would like to start? Maybe some people who have been a little bit more quiet just to make sure everyone has a chance to speak.",24
"443","nonR1_2","17","17: Sorry i'll just. I'll just take a stab here. Nice to meet you, everybody, this is this is great. I'm glad we could pop in together. I really feel that I would like to know the process. You know, so not just here's the practice. But what is the process around preregistering and submitting. And what exactly, step by step, more procedural, I guess. I'm very good about following procedures. You know I have an ORCID ID, and and that was kind of the focus on my PhD program was making sure we had that. But there was no discussion, as somebody else had mentioned, on open science. It was really...I was at an R1 institution, and it was all about grant writing and and submitting for NIH and all that. I was in implementation science courses. And so that was a whole different beast. So yeah, I just think a procedure would be very helpful.",25
"444","nonR1_2","10","10: I would say, in addition to the procedure. I also like like, step by step, and you know, as a pre- tenure assistant professor, I'm also very conscious of making sure that that I have data to publish, and making sure that I'm not just looking negative in any way to potential publishers. And unfortunately, that's just the reality of it. However, I would say, all of the above in terms of your list here. I would attend a session on any of this. And also yeah, just knowing my limits and what I can do. What's the appropriate step-by-step procedure to follow? And I would love to hear that from a publisher standpoint. I would love to hear from. You know someone who who does work for a peer-reviewed publication to say, this is okay, this is not. Because that's kind of been my limiting factor, and just again making sure I I do it right, and I kind of protect myself pre tenure.",26
"445","nonR1_2","13","13: I agree with that. I would also say that the self-archiving piece always kind of makes me worry that someone mentioned previously about which version you're going to put out there, and I'm always really nervous unless I have an open access paper that I paid for. I know I can put that anywhere, but if it's not open access like which version can I put up individual independently, because I don't want to like have to go to court because I did something wrong. I'm probably catastrophizing it, but that for me. Procedurally I've learned about it, but it would be really great to have like a step-by-step like this is the version you upload. If you have this kind of level of copyright, etc., so that one I think i'm most hesitant with. The other ones I feel a little bit more comfortable.",27
"446","nonR1_2","15","15: I'd like to to add that not only would it be helpful to hear it from the publisher's point of view. But I would really, really love a talk through on each of those topics. That's specific to my institution. Because I really do feel often that I am fighting a fight without the support of the librarians that that would be so beneficial to me. Which person do I need to talk to? To talk about the open data processes within my institution. Which person do I need to talk to? For. Yeah. You get the idea.",28
"447","nonR1_2","17","17: For me, You know. I'm curious about like how to kind of manage the cost of publishing open access. Because typically, just to publish doesn't cost anything but making it open access adds a cost. So, I don't know if my university would be willing to cover that. Additionally, you know, my IRB, sometimes I I perceive them as kind of like worrying about things excessively. So if I were to share data openly, I'm worried that the IRB would shut that down at my university, or I would face backlash from them. Yeah, so I think like just kind of knowing how to navigate those issues would be helpful for me to know, kind of like the best place to start, and then the best way to move forward with it.",29
"448","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you all for sharing. Oh. Did someone have something to add?",30
"449","nonR1_2","12","12: Yeah, can I add one more point quickly? ",31
"450","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah.",32
"451","nonR1_2","12","12: So similarly. Yeah, from the IRB perspective, just knowing if it's okay to post the identified data publicly. If I didn't explicitly, write that in the IRB. And in the consent form. Yeah, is a question of mine, and then in terms of self archiving. So I've done preprints before, but I'm always sort of unclear about okay. Once that actually gets accepted and published. What do I do with the preprint? Do I leave it up? Do I update it? Do I take it down? I don't know. I could probably figure it out. But I don't know at this point. And then, in terms of another topic, open educational resources is something I don't know a whole lot about from this list.",33
"452","nonR1_2","F","F: Great. Thank you. So, the next question is, then how would you prefer to learn about open science practices? And there are a couple of examples listed here, but don't feel limited by those options.",34
"453","nonR1_2","17","17: Yeah, for me. Just the way, I learn an interactive workshop would be best for me, which I know takes more time. But you know, having something where I get to walk through what that process looks like with someone have a live discussion about it. Which you don't, get that like always good question and answer within a live webinar and you don't have that opportunity within a pre-recorded webinar. Handouts. When i'm writing any kind of research, I go back to textbooks. I go back to the APA website. So, I just like to have a list of resources on hand that I can pull whenever I need them specifically at that time, rather than having to go and talk to someone or go and listen to a webinar. Just having something that I can pull up for myself so it's easy.",35
"454","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you. Does anyone have any other thoughts or opinions?",36
"455","nonR1_2","11","11: I would just add Youtube videos, I mean, I know that those are, you know. It's nice to have something where you can jump around pretty easily. So Youtube videos that are tagged with chapters or things like that so you can listen to a little bit at a time. Or find the bit that you need. I think, sometimes pre recorded webinars, it's a little bit more difficult, depending on the format, for me to find the information that I need within the the Webinar. So Youtube videos tend to break things down, and sometimes I don't have more than 5 minutes, you know, between jumping around with different tasks, to be able to find what I need.",37
"456","nonR1_2","17","17: Yeah. So sorry I'll add my 2 cents that interactive workshop, handouts, and Youtube videos are three avenues that I use regularly to learn from. So, if it was in at least those three formats, it would be helpful to me.",38
"457","nonR1_2","10","10: I agree. I like that, you know, with with handouts and Youtube videos specifically. You know, you can access those when you're ready for the information, because I think you know, open science as a whole is a very big, broad topic. And so, you know. Being able to target those, like someone you had mentioned like tagged sections. I think it's really helpful to get that information when you need it, and I think that's been a contributing factor to me not attending webinars in the past, just because I wasn't ready for the information.",39
"458","nonR1_2","13","13: I think also just ease of finding prerecorded webinars is sometimes difficult. And I agree that being able to kind of jump around in a Youtube video is really nice. Or just having them in really short snippet. So here's a 5 minute introduction on X or on Y, and then, having, you know, a handout that's related to it, so that you have, like the step-by-step on a piece of paper that you could potentially follow along with while you're watching the Youtube video or just as a reminder, of after I've watched the YouTube video, this is my step-by-step, for you know, uploading a preregistration or something like that. So yeah, I think the compilation of what other people have said would be incredibly helpful.",40
"459","nonR1_2","F","F: Alright. Thank you.",41
"460","nonR1_2","15","15: I'm sorry. Can I add one thought? Just off the top of my head as I'm going through this for my purposes and learning to to go through the open science from the beginning of an experiment, research project, whatever, to the end it would be like, it would be beneficial to have like a cohort group of hey, i'm going to start an open science project, and we'll meet once a month between this time and this time. And where are you? What do you need? What's the current problem? Just to to, like an interactive work group, rather than a workshop.",42
"461","nonR1_2","15","15: Yes, exactly a learning community. Thank you. X.",43
"462","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, thank you for sharing. So on to the next question. So now we'll discuss 4 different open science practices in more detail. The first is pre registration. Preregistration is the process of posting an outline for a proposed research project on a preregistration, repository, such as the open science framework before data, collection and or analysis preregistrations typically include research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. What do you perceive to be barriers to preregistration, preregistering your own studies? And I just want to remind everyone feel free to contribute as much as you want.",44
"463","nonR1_2","15","15: So I I'll I'll. My contribution is really short. It's just honestly my own organizational practices are the biggest barrier for me preregistering.",45
"464","nonR1_2","10","10: I was just gonna say at the risk of looking ignorant. It's kind of the vulnerability of posting your ideas before you've done this study. And, you know I have been in a situation where we preregistered the protocol, and also published the protocol for something, and I mean a peer viewer should have recused themself but they tried to to deny the article or reject the article because they were doing something similar. So it was kind of a weird situation, and so that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.",46
"465","nonR1_2","13","13: I think there's also different stages where you can preregister. So I find it a good time to preregister is when you’ve collected the data, but you haven't analyzed it yet. So you like, kind of have a sense of like what your age group is, and how many kids, I work with kids. How many kids you've already recruited to participate. So, like you haven't done any of like the data cleaning or the data processing or the analyses. So you still have really sound research questions, hypotheses, and methods. But you've already kind of collected the data. So, the most recent preregistration I did, we did it in that format. And so also create the education around. What types of pre registrations out there. When is it a good time to pre register to kind of help with some of those barriers. But I think for me, I actually find it a huge advantage because it really gets you set up to get ready to go. But I agree with the previous comment that just getting yourself organized and put together like even writing the preregistration can take weeks to get yourself set up and ready to go. Sorry. One thing to add there to is like. If there's any changes from your preregistration, and you're writing it in your manuscript, you tend to have to take the space to then explain that the differences between what you preregistered and what actually happened. So, depending on word count and things like that that could potentially be a barrier.",47
"466","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, thank you for sharing so kind of follow up. Question what factors currently facilitate your ability to preregistration your own studies, or could facilitate your ability to preregister your own studies in the future?",48
"467","nonR1_2","12","12: So I think my comment kind of addresses this question and the past one. So I think I would be motivated by, if there is some sort of direct benefit to me of doing this, because right now I feel like I'm I lack the motivation to do right preregistration, because it's not something that is, looked for, say, in my promotion or tenure reviews, and it's not valued by my university. So, if it were something that became an expectation within my department or college or university. That would be motivating because it feels like it's extra work I would need to do that I just don't have to do. And I have a lot of other things I need to get done on the tenure track, as we all know.",49
"468","nonR1_2","17","17: I do have a question about this process like when I write IRBs, I'm doing all of this. Like, I've taken the time to write the research question and the methods. And you know, then, once it gets approved and all those forms are in place, then I would feel comfortable. I don't know copying, or having IRB send that information to preregister. But having to duplicate that work. You know, I don't have time for that, as some of you've already said, so does anyone know if there's sort of like this once you've been approved by IRB whether that information can be sent as a preregistration for this process?",50
"469","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, I I guess we don't know. But so regarding the question, though, does anyone have any other comments or thoughts? I'm just looking through the list here, X, you've been quiet. Do you have anything to add? It’s ok if you don’t.",51
"470","nonR1_2","18","18: I don't to this particular question. My answers are pretty much aligned with what everyone has said. The only thing different is that I'd say my main source of familiarity with open access is  through the talk bank records.",52
"471","nonR1_2","F","F: Ok, Thank you for sharing. So with that, we'll move on to the next question. So, the next open science practice we will discuss is self-archiving. Self-archiving involves making a version of a manuscript legally and freely available on a lab website, personal website, or in a repository. What do you perceive to be barriers to self-archiving your work?",53
"472","nonR1_2","12","12: It kind of came up earlier, but just keeping track of what versions are allowed for which journal. And every time I look into, you know, dig into the requirements for the journal, and I pull up the page, and I use the site that you can search for requirements. And still, it's really confusing to me. And then, so most of my work has been NIH-funded, which typically allows for open access after a year. So, I've sort of defaulted to, well, I'll just wait a year, and then I can make that version available.",54
"473","nonR1_2","F","F: Yes, thank you for sharing. Does anyone have any other thoughts about it?",55
"474","nonR1_2","11","11: I think this also came up earlier, but just having the time also to make a personal website. Some like, I think it was X who mentioned that that there's some, you know, formats. The university has a special format of how they want you to have your profile set up on the University website. So there's limitations to perhaps what can be posted there. So yeah, I I did make myself a personal website, and it does take a lot of time and work, and kind of wonder if it's really, you know, worth it. But that's that's my main area.",56
"475","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. So kind of a follow up to that question. So what factors currently facilitate your ability to self- archive your work for could facilitate your ability to self-archive your work in the future?",57
"476","nonR1_2","15","15: My previous institution had a very active librarian and a seamless, like, once a quarter we got a reminder email. Hey? Have you gotten any articles submitted or published? Would you like to archive them? And all I had to do was send them the title and the the journal, and they did all the contacting and figured out which draft needed to be...it was wonderful. I need the idiot proof version.",58
"477","nonR1_2","16","16: That sounds amazing. I also want that. I started to follow up on X’s comment, like there is. So so I am in year one of this situation here, and I just sometimes feel like the whole process. It's not...like even the traditional publishing process is not wildly transparent, and there's so much variability. And like as a new, like as a  clinician turned researcher. I am just like half the time I'm like I don't actually know how to get this done the standard way, let alone this more equitable, open access way which I believe in. I just am still feel like I'm figuring out sort of the rules of the road, like the road more traveled. The other element of this is that I am at a university that is a regional campus of a flagship state school. And so there's department, college, university here and then there is what we jokingly refer to as the mothership downstate. And then there's all of their rules. And so I just need to understand, like for me, facilitating this process would be. I need to figure out what is my hierarchy? Who do I talk to? How do I get this all figured out?  Which could be a me problem and it's not something that everyone else deals with. But...it's...there's just a lot out there. Of like layers.",59
"478","nonR1_2","12","12: Yeah, to kinda to follow up to that comment. In I think my first year of my faculty position I was really motivated to self-archive, and have, you know, really accessible on my website a list of all of my manuscripts that are available. And so, I had a grad student take some time, and you know, figure out the requirements to the best of her knowledge, and tell me which copies of things. And so then I went to the person who manages the faculty websites, and said, hey, I want to do this thing. It's this movement within the field to be more transparent, open. And she said. Oh, well, a lot of faculty end up forgetting to update their manuscript list, so we just don't allow them to be posted at all. So like well, you know. So that was just one example of trying to put in the work and then meeting resistance due to all of these layers, and figuring. Well, you know. This should be a straightforward thing. But there's all these things that make it difficult to actually implement.",60
"479","nonR1_2","F","F: Yes, thank you for sharing. So, kind of moving forward. The third open science practice we'll discuss is gold open access. This is the process of paying a fee to publishers to make an article available for others to read for free. What do you perceive to be the barriers of publishing, using gold open access?",61
"480","nonR1_2","13","13: I will say that. Sorry. But in my department we're really lucky that we have a clinic that makes a little bit of money, and we're actually able to pay. I think the biggest barrier is, where do you find the funds to be able to pay for open access? I think that's the biggest in smaller departments like ours.",62
"481","nonR1_2","15","15: I would add that that the funding is a huge issue. Specifically, when you're not in an R rated institution right? Because we don't have research assistance. We don't have lab space. We don't have let alone, just flat out cash to pay for an open access readership.",63
"482","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. Oh.",64
"483","nonR1_2","17","17: Yeah, really quick. That's what I was gonna share is just the cost associated with it. My university university doesn't have a lot of funding. I have no experience with grant writing, so I don't even really know how to access funding for opportunities like this.",65
"484","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah. So I guess the follow up questions sent to the barriers. What factors currently facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access, or could facilitate your ability to publish using gold open access in the future?",66
"485","nonR1_2","17","17: Would you please define the difference between gold access and the other access? I I'm not too clear on the differences between them.",67
"486","nonR1_2","F","F: So yeah, just a quick recap gold. Open access refers to when you're paying a fee to the publisher to make your article. Oh, your final published article! Open access! So, oh! Being able to share it freely. Self-archiving. When you're sharing a preprint or post print version of your manuscript on your own website or repository, without involving the publishers to make that freely available. That's difference here.",68
"487","nonR1_2","10","10: I would say. A facilitator has been when I have grant funds, and I can pay for it. But you know I I am at an institution that it's an R2, specifically, and the vibe here has always been uou pay for it yourself. So yeah, I mean gold open access, standing for gold in the amount of money that you need to have for it.",69
"488","nonR1_2","13","13: Also, if you know, the Dean of the college is willing to put his or her money where his or her mouth is, or their money, in terms of having a pot of money for faculty to pull from. I think X had previously mentioned that at her institution their library has some money to pay for open access. I know my library also has that, but the money is distributed equally between authors. So if there's three authors on my paper, my library is only going to pay for the one-third for me, and then the other 2 thirds, even even if I'm first author, then the other 2 thirds need to be covered by someone else. So that makes it a little bit difficult at my institution. So having a pot of money either at the library or within the Dean's office, would be really helpful. ",70
"489","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, X, you raised your hand.",71
"490","nonR1_2","17","17: Yeah. maybe this is just me being idealistic, but you know we already don't get any financial kickback from publishing, and so I feel like the cost associated with publishing open access is pretty inequitable. We, I mean, at my university unfortunately, like we are, we we don't get paid like a very high salary and trying to bridge that research to practice gap through open access, then basically punishing us by making us pay for something when we already don't get any monetary gain from publishing it. Personally, it makes no sense to me, so I don't see like, if the idea is open access, then why do we have to pay still for open access? That seems like it doesn't accomplish the spirit of open access science.",72
"491","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing.",73
"492","nonR1_2","18","18: So just add to that, I would also say, I also think it kind of defeats the purpose of open access, and that it's supposed to be for everyone and make this, I would think, a more like transparent and diversified research environment where it, when it's paid for it, kind of limits who can participate in that. And what type of research is even getting published on it.",74
"493","nonR1_2","F","F: Yes, thank you for sharing that. So, moving on to our last open science practice, we'll discuss is open data. Open data is the process of publicly sharing research data and/or resources needed for data collection, such as methodology, protocols, or software packages. Open data is typically made available on online repositories. What do you perceive to be barriers to the open data process?",75
"494","nonR1_2","12","12: This is similar to an answer I gave on another one, but just it. I don't perceive a lot of benefit to myself, and that sounds selfish because it is, but I have to watch out for my own time. And so yeah, I just don't see a lot of external motivation, and it’s opening up myself up to potential criticism. Not that I think that there's anything wrong with my stimuli. But yeah, just lack of external motivation or incentives.",76
"495","nonR1_2","13","13: I think also in terms of protocols or more of like my R syntax, or something like that, is taking the time to clean it up. Rather than like the shorthand that it's currently in to be able to make it readable by someone else, just taking the time to to clean it up and make it public facing.",77
"496","nonR1_2","11","11: I just I. This was kind of something that came up when you were asking about I think one of the previous questions, but I know a lot of grant applications these days do require you to have some kind of data management policy, particularly with the focus on open data and data sharing. So I think just a better maybe understanding of what the...you know, what's required in terms of the the funders and grantors. And what what kind of data they want us to share, and where they'd like us to share it. As as supportive as our library is our ITS is maybe not so much so. We don't have access to some of the the programs like. Of course, now I can't think of it. We have Qualtrics, but we don't have what's it called? Red Cap. Thank you. Because they have some concerns about you know, anyways. So that's been the the bane of my existence recently, but just having access to some of those database programs as well.",78
"497","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. Does anyone have anything to add? So, the follow up question again. What factors currently facilitate your ability to use the open data process, or could facilitate your ability to use the open data process in the future.",79
"498","nonR1_2","15","15: More knowledge. an existing infrastructure.",80
"499","nonR1_2","F","F: I see head nods.",81
"500","nonR1_2","13","13: Like what is best practice? I think there is another comment in the chat about that. Like how to best do it. I know some NIH institutes have repositories and have it very clearly spelled out, while other institutes leave you to your own devices to do it. So how do we go about doing it? Because it is required by many grants now.",82
"501","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you. Sorry. I advanced to the next question a little bit sooner than I wanted to. But regarding the open data facilitators, is there any other comments about that?",83
"502","nonR1_2","10","10: I think the you know direction NIH is going is really going to be a benefit as as money growing pains as it gave me at the beginning of this year. You know I do think it's going to encourage our institutions to kind of step up to the plate a little bit in, you know, helping to facilitate open data.",84
"503","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, Thank you for sharing. So, the next question, since it's already on our screen, what impact do you think open science practices could have on the field of communication sciences and disorders? And you can consider this question from either research or clinical practice standpoint.",85
"504","nonR1_2","14","14: I guess it will facilitate a lot of replication studies. You can use the same stimuli, same protocol. Everything is available online. You can use it. Say, like a different population of same population that replicate those results.",86
"505","nonR1_2","15","15: I think you. I'm sorry. I would hope it would also facilitate research getting to practice more quickly as clinicians could locate things without cost to themselves.",87
"506","nonR1_2","12","12: That was going to be my comment, too.",88
"507","nonR1_2","16","16: I think that there's also an element of sharing what the research process is truly like with clinicians. I know as a clinician I didn't completely understand, like, in order to get through IRB or in order to move the publication process along exactly how narrow any given research study needed to be. And I think the more that clinicians, we pull back the veil a little bit on like how the science is produced. Then clinicians can better understand, like how this is being created. And so, then there is mutual understanding on both sides of, we want you to have access to the science. We want you to know how we create the science. Or, you know, discover things. So I just think it makes it just a little bit more. Hmm. Knowledge. There's more knowledge for everyone in in the procedures of it all.",89
"508","nonR1_2","18","18: I agree with the last comment, and we'll say that I also use it in my teaching. So, getting, introducing all of the things that were just spoken to students, before they're clinicians.",90
"509","nonR1_2","17","17: That's what I was going to say was getting students interested in and acclimated to research and showing them that it doesn't have to be this big scary process. I think data collection can feeI, I know for me, when I was a student researcher, that data collection was really overwhelming. As well as developing methodology. So, seeing what's out there, and seeing how I can tweak it to my interests, I think would have... I was really interested but I think it might have recruited more of my classmates into research.",91
"510","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you so much for sharing. Just gonna take a beat here. Does anyone have anything else to add to this question?",92
"511","nonR1_2","11","11: Also, just to add that you know, in our field we tend to have fairly small N studies just because of accessibility of research participants. And so you know the more that we share things openly, particularly data in that sense, it's easier to combine results from different studies to to sort of answer, maybe different questions than we could answer individually in our little, you know, silos.",93
"512","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing that. Okay. So what impact do you think open science practices could have on your career, if any?",94
"513","nonR1_2","18","18: I think it might be a good way to meet collaborators and maybe expand what you're looking at, and who you're working with.",95
"514","nonR1_2","14","14: I guess it should have helped me in taking up projects that you know I I didn't have enough technical skills on. If I had the protocol ready stimulus ready from somebody else... in general, it would have helped me in taking up more projects that conceptually make sense to me, but not really have matlab skills or python skills to run the protocols. So yeah...",96
"515","nonR1_2","12","12: Yeah, I think it could help cut down on redundancy of lots of research groups doing the same sort of work in terms of getting stimuli processed and recorded and edited and cut out all that sort of extra work and allow us to focus more on doing the actual research. And then, additionally, in terms of me, potentially doing more open science practices, I think it could potentially help people to have more faith in the type of research that I'm doing and view me as a stronger researcher if I'm consistently doing more of these open science practices, potentially. If it becomes something that people value more and becomes more common.",97
"516","nonR1_2","13","13: Also for some it might help with the tenure process. I know some institutions really look at the H index and things like that like how often you're being cited, and so, if more work is open access, then more people can cite your work. And then that kind of boosts those scores for those institutions that are really looking for you to have a really broad reach, rather, whether it's nationally or internationally, to show that your your work is having an impact in your field.",98
"517","nonR1_2","17","17: For me, I mean it just comes down to my ego. I think the research that I have done, and I'm going to be doing is really cool, and I want other people to read it. I focus a lot more on like implementation science and I'm dipping into scholarship of teaching and learning. And so that's just going to benefit what we do in terms of how we approach our practice, and so getting my name out there and letting people see what I've done. And then just becoming like a name in the field. That's one of my career aspirations.",99
"518","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you all. So much for sharing so the final question, what did we miss. Are there any other comments that you would like to make about using open science practices? So kind of an open floor type question. Yeah. And just giving that moment in case of you want to share something.",100
"519","nonR1_2","17","17: I would just be...like, I'm just curious about what open science looks like within other fields. And how our field compares. Because typically, since we're newer, we're a little bit behind. And so I'm curious to see like what other fields of research and what other professions have embraced open science and what that looks like for them.",101
"520","nonR1_2","F","F: Yeah, thank you for sharing. Does anyone else have any other comments or thoughts?",102
"521","nonR1_2","17","17: Well, I just. I just suggested that if there's any way to get a list of mentors, let's say, maybe in a different category of institutions. Like I'm at an R2 institution. So we're...and I’d done my PhD in an R1, and I found that just that little change in category makes a huge difference in what's available to us, as far as knowledge and process and procedures. So having, maybe somebody who is in our particular institutional category to help step us through maybe some unique procedures and processes that are preventing us from being more involved.",103
"522","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing that. And again, just giving a moment. If anyone else wants to add anything.",104
"523","nonR1_2","10","10: Just to I guess comment on that. Or follow-up on that comment. I'm, thinking in terms of resources for those of us whose institutions are less familiar with open science, it may be helpful just to have a a list or some sort of reference, to be able to give to our institutions, or give to our library, saying why this is important. You know, what are the benefits, and what are the barriers, so that you know, it's not just each of us fighting the fight individually.",105
"524","nonR1_2","F","F: Thank you for sharing. Any other comments before we wrap up? Okay? Well, seeing that I want to thank you all very much for participating in this focus group discussion. We hope you found the discussion interesting, and you all have shared some valuable information with us, and we are very appreciative of your time.",106
