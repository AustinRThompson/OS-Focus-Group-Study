1,10,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/19/2023 13:37,PW,I have some on a personal website. 
1,12,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/19/2023 13:41,LOA-IR,completely aware of what kind of institutional repository options are available to me
1,12,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/19/2023 13:56,R-UCSD,I have definitely used the CSDisseminate resources before
1,17,Austin Thompson,9/21/2023 15:38,U-OS,I don't know if this counts
1,18,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:25,PE-OA,"But if I have a a manuscript that was funded by NIH, and is now publicly available after the embargo period"
1,18,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:29,PE-NIH,"I have a a manuscript that was funded by NIH, and is now publicly available after the embargo period"
1,20,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:27,"PE-OA, PW","I've been putting links to it on my faculty web page, so that if somebody was to Google or look for my article and it was behind the paywall, the journal. They at least have a link then to it"
1,22,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:31,KOP-NIH,"They at least have a link then to it, for where where you have to deposit it for NIH, so they have the publicly available copy, not the pretty journal formatted copy."
1,22,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:10,U-OS,"So, I guess I don't know if that counts"
1,26,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:32,PE-OD,I have been involved in groups who have posted their data on OSF
1,28,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:37,U-OD,"I, personally, I’m just not sure like what I’m allowed to post, since, like I have a lot of recordings of children's voices and haven't specifically asked for permission to post their voice recordings online"
1,28,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:45,P-OD,haven't specifically asked for permission to post their voice recordings online
1,30,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:56,P-OD,"trying to figure out what I'm allowed to post and and share, and what I should keep private."
1,30,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:55,N-OD,"So, I I just feel a little bit nervous trying to figure out what I'm allowed to post and and share, and what I should keep private."
1,35,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:58,PE-OM,I have provided materials online that were used in my studies for researchers or clinicians who were interested in using them
1,35,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",6/28/2023 16:58,PE-OD,I've also submitted data to our RHD bank
1,37,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:13,SJ,"I've also submitted data to our RHD bank. So I've done through through them. I've I I know they're still. It's not a paywall, but at least there's, it's available to a lot of researchers there."
1,43,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 15:45,"PE-OM, PW",I'd posted them on a lab website for other people who were interested in.
1,44,Danika Pfeiffer,8/8/2023 20:33,PE-SARP,"And I've also posted like after the fact, posters and links to like Powerpoint Presentation PDFs."
1,45,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 15:51,PW,After a talk I'll I'll try to post those on on my lab website as well.
2,3,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:10,U-OS,Do you include like open access journals in this?
2,4,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:04,PE-OA,"I have a article published in open access journal, which was is good. That's probably my most of my experience there"
2,13,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:11,A-CSD,I'm familiar with CSDisseminate.
2,14,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:13,Imp-OS,I know that open science is important
2,14,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:15,A-OS,I know that open science exists
2,15,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:17,LPE-OS,"I know that open science is important, and I know that open science exists. But I have not really taken the steps to do any of this myself."
2,20,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 16:31,PE-PR,I have just submitted my first pre-registration or report to OSF in the last year. This was my first time doing that. 
2,22,Austin Thompson,10/2/2023 15:30,"F-CS, F-PR","I'm working with a collaborator who is her job, she's like the Open Science librarian at the X, and so she's kind of walking me through all of it. "
2,28,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:01,KOP-PR,"we're really having to stick to what we said we were going to do in terms of the analyses that we set, you know we were like we are going to do these Bayesian tests, and only when we have enough power we'll be peek at the data, and it's been an interesting experience actually having to stick to those rules and and convincing everyone on the team that right, like there's a reason that we're doing that"
2,28,Austin Thompson,10/2/2023 15:31,"B-PR, B-CBI","it's been an interesting experience actually having to stick to those rules and and convincing everyone on the team that right, like there's a reason that we're doing that"
2,29,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:05,PE-PR,This is all very like new for me. 
2,30,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:08,E-OS,"But I was excited to do this because I feel like I'm just dipping my toe into this water, and kind of like experiencing it for the first time. "
2,36,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:30,PW,I have a website where I post all of my manuscripts.
2,37,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:30,PE-SA,"I do some self-archiving. I have a website where I post all of my manuscripts. I go to the CSDisseminate website to see, you know, like which journals let you post accepted copies and etc. "
2,37,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/5/2023 17:30,R-UCSD,"I go to the CSDisseminate website to see, you know, like which journals let you post accepted copies and etc. "
2,38,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:12,PE-SARP,"I post my, most of my presentation slides and posters on the same website,"
2,38,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:18,DUR,"I always offer to like, my data is available upon request,"
2,39,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:14,SJ,"I know that that's not as good as like sharing the data publicly,"
2,40,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:21,I-OD,"I know that that's not as good as like sharing the data publicly, and that's gonna be something I hope to do in the future."
2,40,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:22,DUR,But as for now it's just like upon request.
3,3,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:29,TE-PhD,"During my PhD, we had a weekly research meeting, and usually it was people sharing the research they were doing. But one year, one one week of the 5 years I was in my PhD someone presented on open science and recommended that we post our data onto OSF."
3,3,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:31,TE-OD,"But one year, one one week of the 5 years I was in my PhD someone presented on open science and recommended that we post our data onto OSF."
3,11,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:47,"R-UCSD, TE-W, TE-OS",I went to one of those zoom CSDisseminate webinars that you had
3,15,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:50,"R-UCSD, TE-W, TE-OS",I did the same
3,25,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:51,"TE-PhD, TE-OS","I think I have a similar experience to X, where we it was either like one class session or one colloquium meeting, and somebody presented on open science, and was like, hey, this is a good idea we should do more of this."
3,25,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 14:55,TE-NE,But it wasn't particularly extensive
3,32,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:08,"TE-PhD, TE-PR",I recall that in our systematic review class we talked about sort of the registration of a systematic review protocol
3,33,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:08,U-OS,"I don't know if that would be considered open science, I think it would be"
3,34,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:10,TE-NE,"Originally I was going to say, I don't think I got any training in this. But as X and X who were talking, I recall that in our systematic review class we talked about sort of the registration of a systematic review protocol. And I don't know if that would be considered open science, I think it would be. And that's basically the extent to which it was ever discussed."
3,40,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:13,TE-NT,"I was gonna say I don't think I have ever attended a talk, or a webinar, or anything that was specifically about open science practices"
3,42,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:18,A-OD,"But it's just kind of maybe thrown in like if in a presentation, or you know a talk, someone will say, well, I use you know our RHD Bank, or whatever Aphasia Bank, so you should consider that as well."
3,43,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:19,TE-NT,I don't think I've ever had anything devoted to open science
3,43,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:19,TE-NE,Just kind of little bits and pieces along the way
4,5,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:20,WTL-OS,I would like to learn more about all of them
4,9,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:22,PE-OA,"The open open access paper that I published was because the Autism and Developmental Language Impairments Journal was like just getting started, and they sent out a like call for papers. That was like, if you submit within this window, we'll publish it for free, and then I missed the window. So, I had to send them the email. But that's really the only reason that it is published where it's published right now. "
4,9,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:24,F-OA,"That was like, if you submit within this window, we'll publish it for free, and then I missed the window. So, I had to send them the email. But that's really the only reason that it is published where it's published right now. "
4,10,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:26,WTL-OS,So really learning more about what is out there would be helpful.
4,18,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:10,WTL-OS,I echo that I'd like to learn more about all of these
4,19,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:10,WTL-OER,"and especially open educational resources, are something that I know very little about"
4,21,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:11,"WTL-OA, B-OA, B-M",when it comes to gold open access I'd like to learn more about funding mechanisms because to publish gold open access is just so expensive and like what what's the best way to get that money?
4,25,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:12,WTL-OS,All of them.
4,27,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:13,WTL-OS,"Yeah, sorry, all of them. Yeah."
4,29,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:14,"N-OD, N-SA","I just am like nervous to venture too far into self-archiving and open data,"
4,30,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:15,"U-SA, U-OD",because I'm just not sure what I'm legally allowed to do.
4,34,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:16,U-OER,I don't even know what open educational resources means.
4,34,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:16,WTL-OER,But I'm so interested by the name.
4,36,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:16,WTL-OS,I would I would agree with everybody who is saying all of them.
4,41,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:17,WTL-OER,"But I know that open educational resources is a really big push at my institution, because we are in sort of a lower SES area that people are really looking at the cost of attendance sort of beyond that, and trying to use as many open educational resources as possible. So I would say that that is definitely an area. If I had to pick one that would probably be the one that would be most relevant to my everyday life."
4,46,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:26,PE-OER,"We're, there's a really big push at my university now, where I'm I got on some task force too for open educational resources."
5,1,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:17,WTL-OER,"Yeah, same. We're, there's a really big push at my university now, where I'm I got on some task force too for open educational resources. But it would like to know more about our discipline specific and just not finding a lot out there"
5,2,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:18,WTL-OD,"and I guess, in terms of open data and how to work with your IRB on that specifically."
5,11,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:19,"WTL-OER, IOS-T","I've also been looking into open education resources. I teach phonetics, and I was like, oh, yeah, there's going to be tons of stuff out there, and the there is not as far...Yeah, right? So I guess I want to learn about finding resources and also about making resources. Like maybe about like networking with people and figuring out, wait like, how do we create that stuff so we can share? For our discipline. You know, for our classes."
5,15,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:19,WTL-OER,I'll go ahead and echo All of these calls for open educational resources
5,16,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:20,WTL-OA,and to a lesser extent like open access journals.
5,17,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:23,"WTL-PR, TE-PR, TE-NT",But I would also like to single out pre-registration. I feel like I just missed that my doc program.
5,19,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:23,"U-PR, B-TE","And now that I've gone through and you know, graduated, I just. I don't know how to learn how to preregister things, and I feel like that's a a big gap in my personal knowledge."
5,24,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:24,"TE-NT, TE-PR","I don't think you missed it. I don't think it was there. I'm just gonna tell you like I don't think, yeah, I just don't think it was there."
5,25,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:25,"F-CS, F-PR, PE-PR","I yeah, I feel really lucky that I have this person. That's the only reason I'm doing it. And she's been like walking me through it. "
5,28,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:25,U-PR,"But I felt the same as you. I don't know that I would have done it on my own, because it felt like I was completely, well I was completely naive to what was supposed to go in there. And you know what are my goals from doing it?"
5,29,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:26,WTL-PR,"So yeah, I would like to learn more about it, too, so I can feel more confident about doing it myself."
5,34,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:27,"B-SD, B-PR, U-PR",I feel like I don't know what to pre-register like I feel like my studies aren't big enough for important enough or using the right methods to preregister.
5,34,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:24,B-LOC,I feel like my studies aren't big enough for important enough or using the right methods to preregister.
5,40,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:28,"WTL-PR, WTL-OER",I think that pre-registration and open educational resources would be the ones I'd be really most most interested in.
5,41,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:28,WTL-OS,But I think I agree also that they're all...I could probably use information about all of them.
5,42,Austin Thompson,7/26/2023 16:28,"WTL-PR, WTL-OER","But if I had to pick, you know, a couple of those would be the two I would pick."
5,44,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/13/2023 15:40,started coding first 3 responses for each question-whole group consensus,F
6,2,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:11,LP-S,The shorter the better
6,2,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:11,LP-H,Handouts
6,2,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:11,LP-V,a simple Youtube video
6,3,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:12,LP-S,To like keep it short and easy to fit into my life.
6,7,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:15,LP-A,Something that I can return to 
6,7,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:15,LP-S,"Something that I can return to also, like short"
6,7,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:15,LP-A,But also I can have access to it all the time
6,12,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:17,LP-H,I was thinking handouts 
6,12,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:20,LP-V,Youtube videos 
6,13,Austin Thompson,8/24/2023 16:34,LP-A,You know something I can do on my own time.
6,23,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:40,"LP-I, U-OS","Okay, I'm going to be Devil's advocate and say that I would like I would like something interactive, because sometimes I feel like...I don't know. I like when I look things up online, maybe my question is so so back, you know, like I'm, I'm. So I'm so novel. It's so new to me, or I'm such a you know I'm such a novice that, like I need to be able to ask questions to make sure I understand what we're talking about, and sometimes it's not. You know I'm basically I'm not gonna find the Youtube video that's gonna get me to the basic level that I need to be at. So I don't know."
6,25,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:41,"LP-I, LP-A","I also. I would like both. You know what I mean. I would like to attend something interactive where I can ask questions and then have things that I can return to later, you know, look-upable things are useful too."
6,29,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:42,LP-I,"Yeah, I I feel like that too. I need something interactive."
6,31,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:43,LP-HA,"Or I need like a working group where I'm accountable. Youtube is not gonna hold me accountable to like that open access, resource or something."
6,31,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:44,LP-I,So I do like something interactive.
6,33,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:45,LP-CP,I don't know if there was anything at ASHA. But if there was something that could be presented at conferences too.
6,44,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:46,"LP-I, LP-A","Yeah, I don't know. But something that I I think I do like the interactive more than if I If I feel like if I had it on Youtube like I would maybe try to fit it in, but it's always like I'll get to it versus like I have to be there at 7 o'clock."
7,2,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:47,LP-H,"I also agree that I think having the handouts, and everything is is great to have."
7,4,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:48,LP-CP,"But also, if there can be, you know, presentations at conferences. That's nice, because I've already carved out time to attend, and it would be a topic I would be interested in."
7,8,Austin Thompson,8/10/2023 14:01,"F-OS, F-CR","And even like a website. That would kind of be a resource for for a lot of these things. I don't know how possible that is, and who would fund it, etc., but something like that would be really good for you, because it could be constantly updated. It'd be one place to go to reach a lot of resources, you know."
7,8,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:48,LP-Web,"And even like a website. That would kind of be a resource for for a lot of these things. I don't know how possible that is, and who would fund it, etc., but something like that would be really good for you, because it could be constantly updated. It'd be one place to go to reach a lot of resources, you know. So, I think that those would all be great if they were if they were available."
7,13,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:50,"LP-I, LP-W",But I was thinking sort of along the lines of we've talked about interactive workshops and in the interactive workshop I might think of questions. 
7,17,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:54,LP-PC,"But if a group like CSDisseminate, or something like that had like a contact person like. If there were a person that you could reach out to with a question. I have no idea about the feasibility of any of that,"
7,18,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:54,LP-W,"but that would be really cool to have a workshop,"
7,19,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:53,LP-I,"But what happens to me more often is I get really excited about something, and then I'll go back to do it and be like. Oh. I don't remember how to do this, and it's not very clear on the handout, so I have no idea if this is feasible. But if a group like CSDisseminate, or something like that had like a contact person like. If there were a person that you could reach out to with a question. I have no idea about the feasibility of any of that, but that would be really cool to have a workshop, and then have somebody that if something came up. You know who to ask and who to contact."
7,19,Austin Thompson,7/31/2023 15:54,LP-PC,and then have somebody that if something came up. You know who to ask and who to contact.
7,30,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:45,B-W,Not knowing where to preregister 
7,31,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:46,B-CM,And concern that my methods and analysis plan will need to shift between preregistration and publication
7,31,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:40,B-PR,Not knowing where to preregister them is one. And concern that my methods and analysis plan will need to shift between preregistration and publication.
7,35,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:50,B-T,"For me it's time. I'm I have a pretty large teaching load, and it's for me sometimes it's like it's one more thing, and if I put something out there, someone I so right now I teach a 3-3 in the fall, because I just got tenured."
7,35,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 13:51,B-TL,"I'm I have a pretty large teaching load, and it's for me sometimes it's like it's one more thing, and if I put something out there, someone I so right now I teach a 3-3 in the fall, because I just got tenured. "
7,40,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/17/2023 14:00,"B-T, B-R",But it's the fact that I don't have as much time and resources

But you know, for studies that have already been done like you can't retroactively do it, so that I think just getting participant consent, and having the mechanisms in place to do it can be potentially a barrier"

13,13,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:40,B-ID,"It would be that almost to the point where you could potentially figure out who they are, if you know where the study was conducted, and kind of some of the specifics of their disease"
13,14,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:39,"B-OD, N-OD","Sometimes I work with pretty specialized patient populations, and when the study has a low n it would make me really nervous to share like lesion data and like it would. It would be that almost to the point where you could potentially figure out who they are, if you know where the study was conducted, and kind of some of the specifics of their disease, so I that would make that makes me nervous, especially with the low n."
13,20,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:47,B-ID,"I'm worried that you know the more my participants share, the harder it's going to be to completely de-identify them"
13,22,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:45,"B-OD, B-SD","I do a lot of mixed methods work, and especially in the qualitative portion. I'm worried about that as well. I'm worried that you know the more my participants share, the harder it's going to be to completely de-identify them, and I don't want my participants to have to worry about you know, the what they share in the interview. I don't want them to have to be concerned about like over-sharing or giving me too much information."
13,29,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:18,"F-OD, F-IS","This is. I wonder if this is another place where library assistance could help? Like if university libraries had open data, repositories and we didn't have to like, find one. I don't. I don't know if that would be useful."
13,32,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:26,"F-OD, F-NIH, KOP-NIH","Well, I think the NIH is changing to require data sharing, so I think that'll be a good facilitator. Anyone who has funding will be forced to."
13,38,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:30,"B-OD, B-ID","I was trying to decide how to frame it as a facilitator but I just I don't know if there is a way to like. So our IRB here thinks that audio recordings, and I don't know how true this is for other places, but those are identifiable, especially with the low n like X was saying"
13,40,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:31,"F-OD, F-DID",So like if there was a way to further de-identify the voices that were...so that it would be less identifiable. Maybe that would be something that would facilitate open data sharing.
13,44,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:00,B-T,"I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do"
13,46,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:59,B-ID,"And making sure it's de-identified, and you know, like the stress was making sure everything's de-identified"
14,3,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 22:53,B-OD,"I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do, like if there's if if it was someone's job to do it, that would be...And making sure it's de-identified, and you know, like the stress was making sure everything's de-identified, taking the time to do that on top of everything else we have to do is faculty, I think. I mean, I think time is a big barrier too with anything that's not required it. It gets pushed and pushed and pushed with everything else that you have to do kind of prioritized."

14,7,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:12,KOP-NIH,"there is an autism repository that I I think you're required to. Yeah. The NIH requires that you any data you collect you have to like, put it in this repository"
14,10,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:13,"B-FR, PE-OD","And as part of my postdoc, like I had, I was the one who had to format the data for that thing. And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then"

I like would never want to do that again, because you know it, it was just who's going to do that? It took so much time. So yeah, time is a huge one"
14,15,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:13,U-SA,"I think, like a theme that's coming out of this just like the archiving thing is people are feeling like they don't know what's allowed, and I think, like straightforward like, what are the things that we're allowed to to to archive or not"
14,16,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:14,U-OD,you know what counts as the de-identifiable or not
14,17,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:14,U-OS,"And if that's straightforward across institutions? Which it sounds like, it's not"
14,24,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:34,IOS-RPG,Reduce the research-to-practice gap! Get it out there faster.
14,30,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:34,IOS-T,"I use some some researchers who have put their their research data on online as a teaching tool like for case studies. So you know, it gives me access to better better teaching cases."
14,31,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:35,IOS-RPG,And I think that also helps again reduce that research-to-practice gap because the students are are practicing with real real cases.
14,36,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:37,"IOS-LS, IOS-MA","On the research side, it would make, you know, meta analyses easier to do, which maybe help us kind of answer some of those questions that are harder to answer with, like the smaller n. And once you've combined a lot of studies together maybe we can start getting your clearer answers to some of the questions that would help clinicians."
14,39,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:18,IOS-RR,"Replication from different labs to see if the things are actually working, or if it's a researcher influence."
14,42,Micah Hirsch,8/8/2023 22:05,CI-MR,Open data would facilitate secondary data analyses which would make life a lot easier for those of us that aren’t in R1or R2 institutions if we didn't have to collect our own data.
15,3,Brittany Ciullo,7/26/2023 23:28,"CI-MR, CI-PT","being able to do research that is, secondary data analysis would be really helpful for me to grow as professional and to, you know, make tenure, and all of those types of things."
15,10,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:06,IOS-LS,"I think this point about especially for clinical research about you know it. People looking at like a small n like X was saying, you know, and and being able to see that across studies, and seeing, oh, this is a consistent finding, especially like clinical finding."
15,17,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:09,IOS-LF," But some sometimes I feel like communication sciences and disorders were sort of like, I don't know it would legitimize us, I guess. A little bit too like in the field of science, like you know what I mean I sometimes it feels like we're a little slower to jump on these on this stuff like here's where science is headed, and here's where we are, and you know, so I think if we were part of that like it would make people recognize this field as a scientific field of study"
15,28,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:40,CI-PT,I liked what X said earlier about it would make it easier for some of us to get tenure.
15,36,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:42,"CI-PT, CI-MP","Especially like X was saying too if I didn't have to conduct a research study every time I needed to publish something. I'm interested in intervention research which takes, you know, a long time to get going, and then maybe I'll get a couple of pubs, but like in the meantime, I have 5 years of work that I have to have publications, and that process can be pretty slow. So if there was a way to access other data or make these connections with secondary analyses, maybe that would be something I could be doing while I was recruiting and and treating participants. So...maybe not early tenure, but at least tenure."
15,38,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:43,CI-MP,"I mean, I think I’d publish more with open data"
15,39,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:43,CI-MC,"I think I'd probably get more citations with open access to my articles, at least, from what I've heard"
15,41,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:49,CI-MT,"If we went back to open educational research resources, I’d probably have more time to conduct research if there were open education resources available."
15,46,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:15,CI-LA," I just wanna the the the audience thing is huge. I mean, you're gonna like, you know, publishing open access just by definition means that you have a bigger audience and sharing your data with like lots of researchers is really exciting, because I was thinking about like an audience in terms of readership, but also in terms of collaborations"
16,2,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:15,CI-FC,"also in terms of collaborations. You know, like you'd be a way to find out what other people are doing, and vice versa for them to find out what I'm doing, and so that would be really exciting"
16,7,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:27,CI-SR,"If your work is more readily accessible to the people who are directly affected by it, then that influences their perception of you, which influences their willingness to support your future research"
16,7,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:26,IOS-IC," I think there's potential impacts with like participants and the communities that we're working with like. If your work is more readily accessible to the people who are directly affected by it, then that influences their perception of you, which influences their willingness to support your future research."
16,18,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:50,WTL-OPR,"Open peer review was in that section of like what are things that we want to learn about? I have never heard of that in my life. So I would, I know that we sort of said all of them, but I and it didn't come up in our sort of questions today, but that would be something I'd be interested in like learning more about. And are there journals in our field that do this? I don't know."
16,24,"Pfeiffer, Danika Lucia - dipalmdl",7/20/2023 16:53,"B-OPR, B-PD, PE-OPR","I was asked to be a reviewer on an open review, and it was for a researcher who I deeply respected, but who scared me, and I decided I did not want to do it, because I didn't want her to, you know, even though I’m sure the review would have been pretty positive. I just didn't want her to associate me with criticizing her work. Granted, she was very senior, and I was a postdoc at the time."
16,36,Danika Pfeiffer,8/10/2023 14:39,F-CR,"I think we need like a repository of lectures and lecture activities and case studies for for, like our field’s teaching, sharing the teaching prep load would be very helpful"

16,41,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:33,IOS-T,"Sharing assignments on canvas too would be really nice to be able to just have...I don't know, like this one canvas for CSD, where you can pull assignments into your course that are already, you know"
17,2,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:42,"F-OER, F-CR","I really wish and hope somebody will go off and get the resources to like build a website where maybe we can sort all of of our instructional, like assignments and syllabi and slides, and all of those things to make the the teaching part more open"
17,3,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:56,IOS-Tr,"I was listening to the discussion of, like the the open reviews, I love the idea of transparency"
17,5,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:53,IOS-RA,"I was listening to the discussion of, like the the open reviews, I love the idea of transparency, especially like for for making people accountable for some of the the harmful and abusive and uninformed things that they say."
17,6,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 15:48,"B-PD, B-OPR","But also there's just this huge power differential there. And I wouldn't be able to review for some of the people that I review for, if they knew it was me reviewing for them"
17,14,Micah Hirsch,7/28/2023 16:02,IOS-T,"Yeah, seeing some like more focus on this, I feel like, and I don't know if it's just because I'm new. But I feel like we are...I've noticed that, like people in this kind of generation are more likely to also share the teaching things like I've had several people just offer me materials, and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I can't. This is so wonderful, you know"
