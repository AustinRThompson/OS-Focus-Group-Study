Open Science Focus Group Transcript-Non-R1 #104/26/2023F: So first, as an introduction, open science refers to a collection of research practices that aim to increase the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. So, what experiences have you had using open science practices? If any.1: I guess I could start. I've done a little bit of self-archiving and keeping track of like what the rules of the different journals that I've published in are so like tracking embargo periods, and knowing what versions I can post, where[1][2]. I have some on a personal website. [3]I’m relatively new to my university. So I don't. I'm not completely aware of what kind of institutional repository options are available to me[4], but I have definitely used the CSDisseminate resources before[5]. F: Nice, perfect. Any other open science practices, or a similar experience you've had within the group.2: I guess I'll go I don't know if this counts[6]. But if I have a a manuscript that was funded by NIH, and is now publicly available after the embargo period[7][8]. I've been putting links to it on my faculty web page, so that if somebody was to Google or look for my article and it was behind the paywall, the journal. They at least have a link then to it[9], for where where you have to deposit it for NIH, so they have the publicly available copy, not the pretty journal formatted copy.[10] So, I guess I don't know if that counts[11], but...F: That is one form of self-archiving. Perfect, any other practices within the group?3: I have been involved in groups who have posted their data on OSF[12]. I, personally, I’m just not sure like what I’m allowed to post, since, like I have a lot of recordings of children's voices and haven't specifically asked for permission to post their voice recordings online[13][14]. So, I I just feel a little bit nervous trying to figure out what I'm allowed to post and and share, and what I should keep private.[15][16]F: Thank you, perfect. Anyone else?4: I I have provided materials online that were used in my studies for researchers or clinicians who were interested in using them[17], and I've also submitted data to our RHD bank[18]. So I've done through through them. I've I I know they're still. It's not a paywall, but at least there's, it's available to a lot of researchers there.[19]F: And when you share the material as a part of the manuscript you submitted? So as a what do you call it?4: Yeah. Oh, so the materials? No, I guess I have done that. I was thinking more that I'd posted them on a lab website for other people who were interested in.[20] And I've also posted like after the fact, posters and links to like Powerpoint Presentation PDFs.[21] After a talk I'll I'll try to post those on on my lab website as well.[22]F: Nice, thank you.5: Do you include like open access journals in this?[23] Yeah. So, I have a article published in open access journal, which was is good. That's probably my most of my experience there[24].F: Yeah, that's one form of open access for sure. So gold open access. Yeah, thank you.6: I'm: sorry, X. I'm Sorry.7: You go. You go. 6: Okay, I just wanted to say that I probably have the least experience with open science. I'm familiar with CSDisseminate.[25] X is a friend. And so that's sort of how I came here, and I know that open science is important[26], and I know that open science exists[27]. But I have not really taken the steps to do any of this myself.[28]F: Sure, thank you.7: I was just gonna say I. I have just submitted my first pre-registration or report to OSF in the last year. This was my first time doing that. [29]I'm working with a collaborator who is her job, she's like the Open Science librarian at the X, and so she's kind of walking me through all of it. [30]And it's been an interesting experience doing this. I actually was just talking about it recently, because I'm collaborating with her, and with another researcher in our field who sort of more. It was like the kind of like the Old Guard, you know, and we're really having to stick to what we said we were going to do in terms of the analyses that we set, you know we were like we are going to do these Bayesian tests, and only when we have enough power we'll be peek at the data, and it's been an interesting experience actually having to stick to those rules and and convincing everyone on the team that right, like there's a reason that we're doing that[31][32]. So yeah, this is all. This is all very like new for me. [33]But I was excited to do this because I feel like I'm just dipping my toe into this water, and kind of like experiencing it for the first time. [34]So yeah.F: Okay nice, so pre-registration. Perfect. Thank you. I think, X, you were also going to share something. 8: Yeah, I’ll jump in. I do some self-archiving. I have a website where I post all of my manuscripts.[35] I go to the CSDisseminate website to see, you know, like which journals let you post accepted copies and etc. [36][37]I post my, most of my presentation slides and posters on the same website,[38] and then I always offer to like, my data is available upon request,[39] and I know that that's not as good as like sharing the data publicly,[40] and that's gonna be something I hope to do in the future.[41] But as for now it's just like upon request.[42]F: Nice. So you're still participating in practices. So, thank you for that. Okay, so I will move on to our next question. I think we covered a lot of practices. So, our next question is, what training experiences have you had? If any, about open science practices?3: During my PhD, we had a weekly research meeting, and usually it was people sharing the research they were doing. But one year, one one week of the 5 years I was in my PhD someone presented on open science and recommended that we post our data onto OSF.[43][44]F: Was it the professor of the class, then, or a student, or?3: It was a professor in the department. Yes.F: Nice. Anyone else?2: I went to one of those zoom CSDisseminate webinars that you had[45]. So that was helpful.F: Good.8: I did the same[46]. F: Okay. 8: That’s been my open science training.F: Okay.1: I think I have a similar experience to X, where we it was either like one class session or one colloquium meeting, and somebody presented on open science, and was like, hey, this is a good idea we should do more of this.[47] But it wasn't particularly extensive[48].F: Okay. So covered to some extent, part of class or through CSDisseminate. I think, X, you wanted to say something. 6: Yeah, I was. I was going to jump in. Originally I was going to say, I don't think I got any training in this. But as X and X who were talking, I recall that in our systematic review class we talked about sort of the registration of a systematic review protocol[49]. And I don't know if that would be considered open science, I think it would be[50]. And that's basically the extent to which it was ever discussed.[51]F: Hmm. So pre-registration for scoping reviews or systematic reviews. Hmm Hmm. Perfect. 4: I was gonna say I don't think I have ever attended a talk, or a webinar, or anything that was specifically about open science practices[52]. But it's just kind of maybe thrown in like if in a presentation, or you know a talk, someone will say, well, I use you know our RHD Bank, or whatever Aphasia Bank, so you should consider that as well.[53] I don't think I've ever had anything devoted to open science[54]. Just kind of little bits and pieces along the way[55].F: Thank you. Anyone else? Oh. All right. Perfect. Let's move on to our next question, then. So what open science topics would you like to learn more about? And these are some suggestions pre-registration, self-archiving gold open access, which is the one you mentioned, X, when you pay for open answers. Open data, open peer, review, open educational resources.5: I would like to learn more about all of them[56]. The open open access paper that I published was because the Autism and Developmental Language Impairments Journal was like just getting started, and they sent out a like call for papers. That was like, if you submit within this window, we'll publish it for free, and then I missed the window. So, I had to send them the email. But that's really the only reason that it is published where it's published right now. [57][58]It was a good opportunity. So really learning more about what is out there would be helpful.[59]F: Okay. Nice. Thank you.1: Oh, sorry. What's that? F: Go ahead.1: I echo that I'd like to learn more about all of these[60], and especially open educational resources, are something that I know very little about[61], and when it comes to gold open access I'd like to learn more about funding mechanisms because to publish gold open access is just so expensive and like what what's the best way to get that money?[62]F: Perfect any other preferences or thoughts within the group?3: All of them.[63]2: Yeah, sorry, all of them. Yeah.[64]3: I just am like nervous to venture too far into self-archiving and open data,[65] because I'm just not sure what I'm legally allowed to do.[66]F: So if you were to choose one...Is there others that you are more interested in then?3: I don't even know what open educational resources means.[67] But I'm so interested by the name.[68]6: I would I would agree with everybody who is saying all of them.[69] But I know that open educational resources is a really big push at my institution, because we are in sort of a lower SES area that people are really looking at the cost of attendance sort of beyond that, and trying to use as many open educational resources as possible. So I would say that that is definitely an area. If I had to pick one that would probably be the one that would be most relevant to my everyday life.[70]F: Nice. Thank you.2: Yeah, same. We're, there's a really big push at my university now, where I'm I got on some task force too for open educational resources.[71] But it would like to know more about our discipline specific and just not finding a lot out there[72], and I guess, in terms of open data and how to work with your IRB on that specifically.[73]F: Nice. Any other thoughts?7: Yeah, I was just gonna jump off of what X said about. I've also been looking into open education resources. I teach phonetics, and I was like, oh, yeah, there's going to be tons of stuff out there, and the there is not as far...Yeah, right? So I guess I want to learn about finding resources and also about making resources. Like maybe about like networking with people and figuring out, wait like, how do we create that stuff so we can share? For our discipline. You know, for our classes.[74]F: Nice. Yeah.8: I'll go ahead and echo All of these calls for open educational resources[75], and to a lesser extent like open access journals.[76] I agree with all of that. But I would also like to single out pre-registration. I feel like I just missed that my doc program.[77] And now that I've gone through and you know, graduated, I just. I don't know how to learn how to preregister things, and I feel like that's a a big gap in my personal knowledge.[78]F: Okay, thank you. Yeah.7: I don't think you missed it. I don't think it was there. I'm just gonna tell you like I don't think, yeah, I just don't think it was there.[79] I yeah, I feel really lucky that I have this person. That's the only reason I'm doing it. And she's been like walking me through it. [80]But I felt the same as you. I don't know that I would have done it on my own, because it felt like I was completely, well I was completely naive to what was supposed to go in there. And you know what are my goals from doing it?[81] So yeah, I would like to learn more about it, too, so I can feel more confident about doing it myself.[82]F: Yeah, it sounds like. Sorry.1: Sorry. I feel like I don't know what to pre-register like I feel like my studies aren't big enough for important enough or using the right methods to preregister.[83][84]F: Okay. So also pre-registration, but like what to pre-register exactly. I think there's still X. Or would you like to share or we can move to? Yeah, the next question.4: I think that pre-registration and open educational resources would be the ones I'd be really most most interested in.[85] But I think I agree also that they're all...I could probably use information about all of them.[86] But if I had to pick, you know, a couple of those would be the two I would pick.[87]F[88]: Okay, perfect. I will move to our next question just for the sake of time. So how would you prefer to learn about these practices? So live prerecording webinars, interactive workshops, handouts, Youtube videos, or any other thing that wasn't mentioned?1: The shorter the better[89]. Handouts[90], a simple Youtube video[91]. Like 10 min tops. To like keep it short and easy to fit into my life.[92]F: Perfect. So something straightforward. Okay.5: Something that I can return to [93]also, like short[94]. But also I can have access to it all the time[95]. Be helpful. F: Okay.8: I was thinking handouts [96]and Youtube videos [97]for the same reason. You know something I can do on my own time.[98]F: Hmm. Hmm.7: Okay, I'm going to be Devil's advocate and say that I would like I would like something interactive, because sometimes I feel like...I don't know. I like when I look things up online, maybe my question is so so back, you know, like I'm, I'm. So I'm so novel. It's so new to me, or I'm such a you know I'm such a novice that, like I need to be able to ask questions to make sure I understand what we're talking about, and sometimes it's not. You know I'm basically I'm not gonna find the Youtube video that's gonna get me to the basic level that I need to be at. So I don't know.[99] I also. I would like both. You know what I mean. I would like to attend something interactive where I can ask questions and then have things that I can return to later, you know, look-upable things are useful too.[100]F: Yeah, or like a recording of the Webinar or something. Yeah, yeah.2: Yeah, I I feel like that too. I need something interactive.[101] Or I need like a working group where I'm accountable. Youtube is not gonna hold me accountable to like that open access, resource or something.[102] So I do like something interactive.[103] Or you're willing. I don't know if there was anything at ASHA. But if there was something that could be presented at conferences too.[104]F: As in a conference presentation, something like that?2: Yeah.F: And for the working group, would that be something kind of like on slack or something like that?2: Yeah, I don't know. But something that I I think I do like the interactive more than if I If I feel like if I had it on Youtube like I would maybe try to fit it in, but it's always like I'll get to it versus like I have to be there at 7 o'clock.[105]F: Sure. Like the accountability piece.4: I was. I also agree that I think having the handouts, and everything is is great to have.[106] But also, if there can be, you know, presentations at conferences. That's nice, because I've already carved out time to attend, and it would be a topic I would be interested in.[107] And even like a website. That would kind of be a resource for for a lot of these things. I don't know how possible that is, and who would fund it, etc., but something like that would be really good for you, because it could be constantly updated. It'd be one place to go to reach a lot of resources, you know.[108] So, I think that those would all be great if they were if they were available.[109]6: I I agree with everything that everybody has said, and I understand that they're different, but I think they all have value, and I think they all add value. But I was thinking sort of along the lines of we've talked about interactive workshops and in the interactive workshop I might think of questions. [110]But what happens to me more often is I get really excited about something, and then I'll go back to do it and be like. Oh. I don't remember how to do this, and it's not very clear on the handout, so I have no idea if this is feasible. But if a group like CSDisseminate, or something like that had like a contact person like. If there were a person that you could reach out to with a question. I have no idea about the feasibility of any of that,[111] but that would be really cool to have a workshop,[112] and then have somebody that if something came up. You know who to ask and who to contact.[113][114]F: Yeah, yeah. Any other thoughts before I move to our next question? All right. So our our next question our next section too. We will be talking about four different open science practices in more detail. So the first one is pre-registration, and I was already mentioned, but I'll describe briefly. So it's the process of hosting an outline of for a proposed research project on a pre-registration repository, such as open science framework before data collection or analysis. They typically include written research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. So, what do you perceive to be the barriers to preregistering your own studies?1: Not knowing where to preregister [115]them is one. And concern that my methods and analysis plan will need to shift between preregistration and publication[116].[117]2: For me it's time. I'm I have a pretty large teaching load, and it's for me sometimes it's like it's one more thing, and if I put something out there, someone I so right now I teach a 3-3 in the fall, because I just got tenured.[118] [119]I will now teach a 4-4, and when I put something out there a a big lab could could do that. Would I what's gonna take me as somebody with a big teaching load with a 4-4 is gonna take me over a year. Somebody's got a lot of resources. It's gonna take them a couple of months, and for me sometimes it's just it's that was my idea, and not that I'm i'm scared of being beings scooped, or whatever. But it's the fact that I don't have as much time and resources[120], being someone with a high teaching load at a very teaching focused university[121]. So that's that's part of it is the the time factor[122], and that that concern to be honest.[123]F: Thank you.6: I also teach a 4-4, or I do teach a 4-4, [124]and I feel like I have enough time. I have a really tough time carving out time for research as it is. So adding an additional step to the research processes like I said, it's going to make it less likely that things get done, and I'm having enough of a tough time getting things done, as it is. [125]Also, sorry I didn't mean to cut somebody off. I justmaybe I just have imposter syndrome or something, but I also don't feel very confident in develop...I obviously I have a PhD. Like, I know how to sort of develop research questions, hypotheses, methods, and an analysis plan. But I I again feel very anxious putting it out there for everybody else, especially like before I'm finished with it, because I feel like I might have missed something, or it just gives me a little bit of anxiety because I still don't feel super confident.[126][127][128]F: Yeah, especially it hasn't gone through peer review yet, and you haven't like it. You're still developing it. I could see that. Yeah, yeah.8: Kind of agree with that that. That really resonated with me. X, you're probably a better researcher than I am. You know I just. I defended my dissertation a year ago. For me research is still a learning process, and without being the most recent big research that I did. My methods changed mid-dissertation. My analysis plan changed mid-dissertation. I know that's poor quality, because, you know, obviously I should have all of that outlined ahead of time, and I should be held accountable to following those, you know, procedures.[129] But I just still feel like, hey, I'm a lousy researcher.[130] My plan A probably isn't going to work out.[131] You know. How do I shift away from something if it's preregistered and written in stone?[132][133]7: I guess I feel like I'm always going to say something controversial. I I I guess, like I would. What everyone saying is making me realize that I think the biggest barriers is that we just aren't used to doing it. [134]We don't know what we're doing[135], and we haven't been trained to do this this isn't how we've been taught to do research our entire, like[136]. I think I'm kind of maybe on on the older end like I finished my, I started my PhD in 2006. I won't say when I finished it, but because it was a long time. But you know this wasn't how we did research. What we did is, we would kind of come up with our analysis plans, you know, as we're going along.[137] And and you know which is yeah, maybe that's not what we're supposed to do, but that's kind of how I was trained to do it, you know, and it was like, oh, let's do a post. We even called a post hoc. It's like, oh, this correlation looks interesting. Let's see right?[138] So there's something kind of scary about coming up with an analysis plan and sticking to it ahead of time. [139]And like I said, I'm doing this for the first time right now. And it is it's interesting how I'm working with these two people, and I have one person who is not comfortable sticking to what we said we are going to do, and this is a very famous person in our field who is very well established.[140] But this is just like not what we've been, how we've been trained,[141] you guys, and so it's not that we're bad researchers, or you know that are stuff is not important enough[142]. I was thinking about what you're talking about with time time, X, cause theoretically, this saves us time right, because, like you, you know, like you come up with what you're going to do, and you know.[143][144]2: It should!7: Right, it should. It's just this is so antithetical to how we've been doing research forever. I think that's what I feel like is the big barrier, you know.[145]F: That's a good point. Thank you. I will move to our next question just for the sake of time. We have 15 questions. I want to make sure we can get through most of them. So our next question is about self- archiving. I know you also mentioned this as a group, and I'll do a brief introduction, so it involves making a version of the manuscript legally and freely available on a lab website, personal website, or repository. So what do you perceive to be the barriers of self-archiving your work?5: I think the biggest one is just knowing like when it's allowed. If you know, if it's not really clear in the journal if that's okay, then that's the biggest barrier for me.[146]4: I agree. I'm. I'm nervous about it. [147]So, for example, on Research Gate, I I will if someone messages me asking for a copy, I always send it to them, [148]but I don't make it publicly available just because I don't want. I don't know if journals are on Research Gate looking for academics to sue or whatever. But I don't want to find out. [149]So that I think just the fact that each journal has very specific requirements makes me nervous.[150] [151]So I think I'm comfortable sharing the the Pub Med, you know version, if that's available, for if it was an NIH funded study[152], but otherwise I I am a little...makes me nervous.[153][154]8: I do a lot of work as second author and third author, and that kind of thing. So I you know I need to get consent from the other authors[155]. At least I feel like. [156]But then often I'm depending on them to send me the accepted manuscript. And either they don't get around to it[157], or don't feel like it, or they're not on board, so that's been a barrier that I've encountered.[158][159]6: I don't really, it's just, it's not a problem. I just have...I don't have a really. We don't have a really robust lab website. I don't have a personal website,[160] so it just seems like there's multiple steps that even if I got something published which I don't have many publications.[161] So that's part one is the issue that again, the time to have manuscripts that I can publish and self- archive.[162] But then the process of like creating the the website or the repository, or wherever it's going to be. It just seems like there's multiple steps,[163] and none of them are pressing, and I don't know about anybody else, but I really respond well to deadlines and pressure, and so this never has a deadline or pressure, so it's never at the top of my list.[164][165]F: X, did you have anything about self- archiving?3: No, just I I don't know what I'm allowed to do[166], and I like...every journal has different rules, so it's not even like I can just say like, oh, I'm allowed to do X. Because ASHA has a different rule compared to you know, Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, [167]and I just. I just don't wanna get sued for sharing my own work that I that I worked on it's a little bit ridiculous that we're not allowed to share our own work.[168] [169]F: Perfect. I think I skipped off factors that facilitate your ability to pre-register studies so I’ll shift gears, I think a little, and then we can go back to self-archiving. So so just so that I don't forget. If there are any also.4: If there is just a one place, I could go and look up the journal, and it would just say what their policy was that would help[170].F: So for self- archiving. I know I...we're okay. Let's stick to what facilitates self-archiving and then I'll jump back to the pre-registration. So yeah, what helps you self-archive? So the website was one. Anything else? There can be none.3: I mean the like. If there were a handout saying like, you know, I think I think someone just said this, but like the journal name, what I am allowed to do legally and just someone explain it to me, and just very easy to understand language that I can be sure I'm not breaking some copyright[171].[172]F: Anything else?1: It would be nice if journals made that information, like every journal has their policy on it, and you can find it.[173] But it's so many steps, and like clicking and digging through everything[174] and it I I mean, I imagine that facilitating self-archiving is not the priority of most for-profit publishers but it would be awfully nice.F: Perfect. Yeah. Okay. So I'll jump back to our preregistration. Did anyone have anything that helps them preregister? I know, X, you said, you have that person. Anyone else has anything that helps them pre-register? And if not, that's okay, too.3: Yeah I mean, it goes back to what someone is saying about like you're not sure what you're gonna do with the stats like. You might make some statistical decision, and it's not the right one. [175]And so like, even like I feel like if I already have my data, I feel much more confident about my stats plan. Then, like if I'm hoping to collect some amount of data. So like, really, where I am in the process, like if I pre-register something, hoping that I'll be able to get, you know, 120 kids, but I only get 60 like that. Like I'm not going to be able to do the same statistical analyses all the time, so like. I think it just depends on where I am in the process of data collection, and like preregistering before I even collect any data. I'm not sure I I want to maintain that that same approach after I get the data[176].7: I just want to add from one thing X said, I know we need to move on. But yeah, just that I think I'm. Something that would help facilitate for me is is what you're allowed to say in terms of exploratory or like, you know this is like, is it a flow...Can I put a flow chart like if I have this many kids? This is what I'll do. But if I have this many, you know what I mean, and and there are things you can do like you are allowed to say those things. Like this is what I would do in this event. [177]But if this doesn't happen, but I but if you haven't so again like what would facilitate it would be like training. I just need to learn what's allowed. I need to learn what you can say, [178]you know, and I just again. I don't think many of us have had that training[179].[180]1: And I also just want to add on really quickly, because I hear everybody talking about their statistical analysis plans, and I do a lot of qualitative work, and, like your research questions can change once you have started analysis, so I feel like the rules become even less clear, and that makes it harder to preregister qualitative studies[181].4: I think I would be more like oh, go ahead! Did you want to move on? F: I'll let you. I'll end this one with you, and then we'll move to the next.4: Ok, I was just gonna say I think I often do is I keep doing studies that are quite different from ones I've done previously, which is, I suppose, good on some levels, but on an another, I think if I was doing a study that was very similar with similar methods. Similar population. You know, and I knew kind of I could kind of predict like, yes, I'll easily be able to get these participants, and so on. I think I'd be more likely if it was just really similar to something I'd done previously. I'd be more likely to be comfortable pre-registering something just kind of having walked through the analysis, having some knowledge of what you know that I've gotten through those barriers that would be concerning. And I I wonder if it's something I would be more likely to do in the future, just because, as I get more comfortable with, if I ever stop doing studies that are totally different, take more time than they should, because I insist on doing something else. I don't know.[182]F: Okay, yeah. So like familiarity and training and doing it more, will make it easier, makes sense. Yeah. Our next practice would be gold open access. So this is when you pay a fee to publishers to make an article available for others to read for free. So what are barriers to publishing open access for you? Money. I see a lot of nods, too. So I think that's echoed by maybe all of you?8: Money is really the only barrier. As far as I can tell.[183]4: My post doc advisor. She never wanted to pay open access fees because we always had to submit everything to to NIH eventually, anyway. So she thought like, why would we spend our money on this when eventually it will be public? So I mean, that was kind of like you're going to do it, anyway. So why are we going to pay $4,000 to do it now?[184]F: So thinking more about the resources and not like keeping maybe the grant money for something else. Okay. Anything else other than money?5: This is probably a really naive question. But what is the difference between what makes it gold open access as compared to other levels?[185]F: Yeah, that's a good question. No. So you pay a fee for the publisher, and it becomes immediately open access as soon as you publish it, and you also own the copyrights to it wherever as when you publish it, kind of like, when what your X mentioned through NIH. So it gets published openly after a certain embargo period. So this is not considered gold open access. So basically paying a lot of money to get it published open access as soon as possible. 5: Thanks. I knew the money was an issue. I just didn't know the difference. [186]F: Okay, perfect. I think we had a lot of agreement on this one, either way. Is there anything that facilitates your ability to publish gold open access so something that helps you do that, or could help you do that in the future.5 : I I tried to write. Oh, sorry X. I just. I tried to write funds for open access, publishing into my startup, and I was denied so. But I guess that would be a barrier, but it would have helped. [187][188]So.F: Makes sense either way. Yeah, X.4: Yeah, I was just gonna say that a couple of times where I'm faculty now and then where I did my postdoc. They, the libraries of those institutions, promoted a deal that they had with a specific publisher, where they were for a certain period of time gonna offer free open access. And I certainly took advantage of that. And specifically, you know, went and picked a journal that was within that publishing suite. So that was great because it was free.[189] But it was that was offered through the institution, and I have no idea like what on the back end was happening, but the library promoted it, and both cases, and I took advantage of it.[190]8: I'll just throw this out there. I'm realistic about my lot in life. I work at a teaching school. Open access fees...The gold open access fees cost more than I'm allotted for research each year. [191]I don't care that much about impact factors. I just want my words on paper. I don't need to submit to the top tier journals. [192]I would be happy submitting to like the open access, CSD journal, if somebody would, you know, peer review and publish my work and share it with a, you know, students and faculty in our field across the country, and wherever.[193]F: So you adopt for kind of a different route of open access for, and it doesn't have to be gold open access then.4: Okay, Sorry. I keep interrupting people. I was just gonna say, my dean at my current institution did advertise that she was also willing in some cases to pay open access fees so to contact her if you had a journal where that would be appropriate, and she would consider it depending on I assuming impact factor, and so on. But that was something I I don't know if that's common, but I was surprised to hear it.[194]F: Any other thoughts? Alrighty. Our last open science practice will be open data. So open data is the process of publicly sharing research data or resources needed for data collection, such as methodology, protocols, or software packages. It is typically made available on online repositories, so such as the open science framework and others that you've mentioned so far. What do you perceive to be barriers to the open data process?6: I can just talk about one specific barrier that I've experienced, which is, I am my dissertation, study, or part of my dissertation study was a replication of somebody else's work with a slightly different population and slightly different methods. And so, when I wanted to share some of those methods, they were still under copyright from their from their published work, they they had given them to me so that I could use them. But I couldn't share them sort of openly and publicly. So that was a barrier that I've experienced.[195]3: My IRB is not willing to let me put anything online like I've I've asked their permission to put things on on like the childes database website, and they refuse.[196]F: Okay. IRB.1: Somebody earlier mentioned participant consent. Which I think, as as I grow as a researcher and my awareness of open science practices, grows. I'm starting to build that into consent processes. [197]But you know, for studies that have already been done like you can't retroactively do it, so that I think just getting participant consent, and having the mechanisms in place to do it can be potentially a barrier[198].[199]4: Sometimes I work with pretty specialized patient populations, and when the study has a low n it would make me really nervous to share like lesion data and like it would. It would be that almost to the point where you could potentially figure out who they are, if you know where the study was conducted, and kind of some of the specifics of their disease[200], so I that would make that makes me nervous, especially with the low n.[201]F: Sure, yes, like it's too much identifying information if it's shared then.8: I do a lot of mixed methods work, and especially in the qualitative portion. I'm worried about that as well. I'm worried that you know the more my participants share, the harder it's going to be to completely de-identify them[202], and I don't want my participants to have to worry about you know, the what they share in the interview. I don't want them to have to be concerned about like over-sharing or giving me too much information.[203]F: Ok. What do you think there are any factors that currently facilitate your ability to use open data or could facilitate your ability to do that in the future? I’ll call them. Yeah. 1: This is. I wonder if this is another place where library assistance could help? Like if university libraries had open data, repositories and we didn't have to like, find one. I don't. I don't know if that would be useful.[204]3: Well, I think the NIH is changing to require data sharing, so I think that'll be a good facilitator. Anyone who has funding will be forced to.[205]F: The policy, ok. I'll call on X. Any thoughts on that?5: I was trying to decide how to frame it as a facilitator but I just I don't know if there is a way to like. So our IRB here thinks that audio recordings, and I don't know how true this is for other places, but those are identifiable, especially with the low n like X was saying[206]. So like if there was a way to further de-identify the voices that were...so that it would be less identifiable. Maybe that would be something that would facilitate open data sharing.[207]F: Any other thoughts that haven't been mentioned?4: I feel like time is such a barrier, you know. Just one more thing to do[208], like if there's if if it was someone's job to do it, that would be...And making sure it's de-identified, and you know, like the stress was making sure everything's de-identified[209], taking the time to do that on top of everything else we have to do is faculty, I think. I mean, I think time is a big barrier too with anything that's not required it. It gets pushed and pushed and pushed with everything else that you have to do kind of prioritized.[210][211]7: Yeah, I agree, I X. I don't know if you know I I was trying this whole time. I've been trying to remember there is an autism repository that I I think you're required to. Yeah. The NIH requires that you any data you collect you have to like, put it in this repository[212]. And as part of my postdoc, like I had, I was the one who had to format the data for that thing. And it was it was horrible like, and I know we kept. They kept coming back. It was not formatted correctly like, and I had the time like that was like part of my job then[213]. But I would. That is a barrier to me right now. I like would never want to do that again, because you know it, it was just who's going to do that? It took so much time. So yeah, time is a huge one[214], and with all the and then what I'll just say, I think, like a theme that's coming out of this just like the archiving thing is people are feeling like they don't know what's allowed, and I think, like straightforward like, what are the things that we're allowed to to to archive or not[215] like, you know what counts as the de-identifiable or not[216] like. And if that's straightforward across institutions? Which it sounds like, it's not[217] so yeah.F: Clear rules and expectations so that everyone can know what's allowed and what's not. Yeah. Okay. So back to like more big picture questions and not specific practices. So, what impact do you think open science practices could have on the field of communication sciences and disorders? And you could think of both research and clinical practice.1: Reduce the research-to-practice gap! Get it out there faster.[218]F: Yes. X agrees too.3: I, you know, like I use some some researchers who have put their their research data on online as a teaching tool like for case studies. So you know, it gives me access to better better teaching cases.[219] And I think that also helps again reduce that research-to-practice gap because the students are are practicing with real real cases.[220]4: On the research side, it would make, you know, meta analyses easier to do, which maybe help us kind of answer some of those questions that are harder to answer with, like the smaller n. And once you've combined a lot of studies together maybe we can start getting your clearer answers to some of the questions that would help clinicians.[221]5: Replication from different labs to see if the things are actually working, or if it's a researcher influence.[222]8: Open data would facilitate secondary data analyses which would make life a lot easier for those of us that aren’t in R1or R2 institutions if we didn't have to collect our own data.[223]6: Yeah, access to participants is really challenging for those of us especially like I, said a teacher. I it's come up a lot. I teach a 4-4 load. I feel like I am barely keeping my head above water like just teaching my classes. So again, collecting data from real life people and coordinating that with my schedule is a nightmare. So second, being able to do research that is, secondary data analysis would be really helpful for me to grow as professional and to, you know, make tenure, and all of those types of things.[224]F: Nice. X, what do you think?7: Yeah, I mean, everyone’s saying good stuff. I think it's I I yeah, I like, I think this point about especially for clinical research about you know it. People looking at like a small n like X was saying, you know, and and being able to see that across studies, and seeing, oh, this is a consistent finding, especially like clinical finding.[225] This is a consistent clinical finding. Or it's not, would be huge. I I was having this weird thought, too, though that, like this, is a totally different way of thinking about open science. But some sometimes I feel like communication sciences and disorders were sort of like, I don't know it would legitimize us, I guess. A little bit too like in the field of science, like you know what I mean I sometimes it feels like we're a little slower to jump on these on this stuff like here's where science is headed, and here's where we are, and you know, so I think if we were part of that like it would make people recognize this field as a scientific field of study[226], you know. So I don't know if that's an okay thing to say. But it was something that I was thinking as I was considering this question.F: Everything is okay to say here. So. 7: Thanks.F: Yes, okay. I think I covered everyone for this question. Our next question, yeah. What impact do you think they could have on your career, and I know this kind of connects to the question before, but feel free to like to elaborate or add to that, too.1: I liked what X said earlier about it would make it easier for some of us to get tenure.[227]5: Especially like X was saying too if I didn't have to conduct a research study every time I needed to publish something. I'm interested in intervention research which takes, you know, a long time to get going, and then maybe I'll get a couple of pubs, but like in the meantime, I have 5 years of work that I have to have publications, and that process can be pretty slow. So if there was a way to access other data or make these connections with secondary analyses, maybe that would be something I could be doing while I was recruiting and and treating participants. So...maybe not early tenure, but at least tenure.[228]8: I mean, I think I’d publish more with open data[229]. I think I'd probably get more citations with open access to my articles, at least, from what I've heard[230]. This might be tangential to your point. If we went back to open educational research resources, I’d probably have more time to conduct research if there were open education resources available.[231]7: Yeah, I just wanna the the the audience thing is huge. I mean, you're gonna like, you know, publishing open access just by definition means that you have a bigger audience and sharing your data with like lots of researchers is really exciting, because I was thinking about like an audience in terms of readership, but also in terms of collaborations[232]. You know, like you'd be a way to find out what other people are doing, and vice versa for them to find out what I'm doing, and so that would be really exciting[233].1: I think there's potential impacts with like participants and the communities that we're working with like. If your work is more readily accessible to the people who are directly affected by it, then that influences their perception of you, which influences their willingness to support your future research[234].[235]F: Perfect. I think we're doing great on time. And we actually got to our last question. So this is where you could basically elaborate anything. So did we miss anything? Are there any comments you would like to make about using open science practices or anything you'd like to, yeah, elaborate on.6: Open peer review was in that section of like what are things that we want to learn about? I have never heard of that in my life. So I would, I know that we sort of said all of them, but I and it didn't come up in our sort of questions today, but that would be something I'd be interested in like learning more about. And are there journals in our field that do this? I don't know.[236]4: I was asked to be a reviewer on an open review, and it was for a researcher who I deeply respected, but who scared me, and I decided I did not want to do it, because I didn't want her to, you know, even though I’m sure the review would have been pretty positive. I just didn't want her to associate me with criticizing her work. Granted, she was very senior, and I was a postdoc at the time.[237] I think it was Frontiers. I think a lot of those journals are open. I could be wrong, but I think a lot of those journals have. Oh, my God...they...F: Like open peer review?4: Yes, thank you. Yeah, yeah.7: That’s what it is. I wanted to know this whole time it's it's so. It's just not blinded. So everyone knows who's saying, what about stuff? Oh. whoa!3: I Also I I keep thinking we need. I mean this isn't quite open research, but I I think we need like a repository of lectures and lecture activities and case studies for for, like our field’s teaching, sharing the teaching prep load would be very helpful[238], and giving me more time for for research, and make my teaching more effective.[239]4: Sharing assignments on canvas too would be really nice to be able to just have...I don't know, like this one canvas for CSD, where you can pull assignments into your course that are already, you know[240]. I don't know if that again maybe not possible. But that would be really nice.F: X and X any final thoughts, too, as we wrap up.8: Just been, you know, nodding my head vigorously to everything everyone said. I really wish and hope somebody will go off and get the resources to like build a website where maybe we can sort all of of our instructional, like assignments and syllabi and slides, and all of those things to make the the teaching part more open[241]. And then, as I was listening to the discussion of, like the the open reviews, I love the idea of transparency[242], especially like for for making people accountable for some of the the harmful and abusive and uninformed things that they say.[243] But also there's just this huge power differential there. And I wouldn't be able to review for some of the people that I review for, if they knew it was me reviewing for them[244].5: I totally agree. I think the ability to hide behind a screen it makes everybody say a lot of things that they wouldn't, maybe otherwise. I do think though, as this open science movement seems to be gaining some traction, and we're seeing some keyboard warriors. Yeah, seeing some like more focus on this, I feel like, and I don't know if it's just because I'm new. But I feel like we are...I've noticed that, like people in this kind of generation are more likely to also share the teaching things like I've had several people just offer me materials, and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I can't. This is so wonderful, you know[245], and I have been surprised by that, because I feel like before, or at least my impression of what academia is is like research, and your teaching stuff is like yours and yours only, and we don't share. And so I'm hoping maybe we'll see some carry-over into all of the areas of academia. If we just...we just all have to keep working together!F: I think that's a beautiful note to end with, for today I really enjoyed our discussion. Thank you so much for your time and for showing up. I'll do just a quick shout out, I think, to OpenCSD. It's a new group that's also focusing on open science. It's a sister group for CSDisseminate, and we've been doing a journal club on open science. So, if that's something you're interested in. That's a space where we're trying to learn about open science together. But other than that, thank you so much. You can look it up online, and we do have a website, and there is a...PE-SAKOP-SAPWLOA-IRR-UCSDU-OSPE-OAPE-NIHPE-OA, PWKOP-NIHU-OSPE-ODU-ODP-ODP-ODN-ODPE-OMPE-ODSJPE-OM, PWPE-SARPPWU-OSPE-OAA-CSDImp-OSA-OSLPE-OSPE-PRF-CS, F-PRKOP-PRB-PR, B-CBIPE-PRE-OSPWPE-SAR-UCSDPE-SARPDURSJI-ODDURTE-PhDTE-ODR-UCSD, TE-W, TE-OSR-UCSD, TE-W, TE-OSTE-PhD, TE-OSTE-NETE-PhD, TE-PRU-OSTE-NETE-NTA-ODTE-NTTE-NEWTL-OSPE-OAF-OAWTL-OSWTL-OSWTL-OERWTL-OA, B-OA, B-MWTL-OSWTL-OSN-OD, N-SAU-SA, U-ODU-OERWTL-OERWTL-OSWTL-OERPE-OERWTL-OERWTL-ODWTL-OER, IOS-TWTL-OERWTL-OAWTL-PR, TE-PR, TE-NTU-PR, B-TETE-NT, TE-PRF-CS, F-PR, PE-PRU-PRWTL-PRB-SD, B-PR, U-PRB-LOCWTL-PR, WTL-OERWTL-OSWTL-PR, WTL-OERstarted coding first 3 responses for each question-whole group consensusLP-SLP-HLP-VLP-SLP-ALP-SLP-ALP-HLP-VLP-ALP-I, U-OSLP-I, LP-ALP-ILP-HALP-ILP-CPLP-I, LP-ALP-HLP-CPF-OS, F-CRLP-WebLP-I, LP-WLP-PCLP-WLP-ILP-PCB-WB-CMB-PRB-TB-TLB-T, B-RB-TLB-TB-PRB-TLB-TB-LOCANX-PRB-PRB-CMSJB-LOCB-CMB-PRB-DU-PRTE-NTB-DB-TEB-FPE-PR, B-CBI, B-CMB-TESJB-PRIOS-STB-PR, B-DB-SA, B-KJPN-SAMURB-FB-KJPN-SAPE-OA, KOP-NIHB-SAN-SAP-SAU-SAB-AMB-CBIB-SAB-RB-CXB-TB-CXB-NEB-SAU-SAB-KJPB-SAB-FF-SA, F-CRLP-H, F-CRF-SAF-SA, F-CRB-CXB-PR, B-CMF-PR, F-DCU-PR, F-ACMF-TETE-NEF-PRB-PR, B-SD, U-PRF-PR, F-SDB-OA, B-MPE-NIH, B-WR, B-OAU-OAU-OAB-OA, B-M, B-RNote: this used to be B-OA, B-M, B-LIS.
