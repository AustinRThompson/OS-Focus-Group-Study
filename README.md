This repository contains the data cleaning and analysis for the project "'1-800-Help-Me-With-Open-Science-Stuff': A Qualitative Examination of Open Science Practices in Communication Sciences and Disorders."

## Project Description
This qualitative study uses focus group methodology to explore the barriers and facilitators to assistant professorsâ€™ use of open science (OS) practices (preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data) in the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) in the USA. Two participant groups will be enrolled:
- 12-20 assistant professors at R1 institutions, as per the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.
- 12-20 assistant professors in institutions not classified as R1 (e.g., R2, doctoral/professional universities).

The study examines perceived barriers/benefits of OS practices, past/desired OS training experiences, and the potential impact of OS on participants' careers.

## Data Preparation Process

1. **Coding Transcripts:**
   - Focus group transcripts were coded according to the procedures outlined in the project preregistration. [View the preregistration](https://osf.io/6yq2s).
   - The transcripts are available [here](https://osf.io/tprzu/).

2. **Extracting Codes:**
   - Codes were extracted from the coder's comments in the Microsoft Word transcript documents using a custom Microsoft Word macro. [Access the macro](https://github.com/AustinRThompson/OS-Focus-Group-Study/blob/cede58e6b1db8e56e1ff99e1dc9febc321248a97/macro_ExportComments.bas).

3. **Matching Codes with Comments:**
   - The extracted codes were then matched with the participants' comments in the Data Analysis Rmd file. [View the Rmd file](https://github.com/AustinRThompson/OS-Focus-Group-Study/blob/cede58e6b1db8e56e1ff99e1dc9febc321248a97/OSFocusGroup_Analysis.Rmd).

4. **Summarizing Codes:**
   - The codes were counted and summarized to obtain a frequency count, which was used to write the study's results.
