1,13,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:44,LPE-OS,I have such limited experience with open science
1,15,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:44,PE-OA, I think one of the most relevant contributions to that question that I could make is that I had a PI once pay for open access to...for for our manuscript to be openly accessible post publication.
1,18,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:45,"F-OA, F-M","I know it's quite expensive, and I know that without funding from the institution under which the research was conducted and the PI's willingness to devote funding to that, we likely wouldn't have been able to take advantage of that option"
1,26,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:53,PE-PR,"I have encouraged my students to do pre-registration for the manuscripts they are working on, and so I also have taught how to do pre-registration in a course"
1,30,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:55,PE-OM,"And I have also done some code-based...code code base using Github and train my students how to use Github, how to collaborate, and how to how to increase the transparency of their research. So in our published papers we have a shared all of our codes for experimental paradigms, and all the and also all the analysis scripts are available on both open science framework and also Github."
1,31,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 18:57,PE-OA, I have also paid the open access fee
1,37,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:09,PE-OM,"So, I'd say most of my open science practices would be related to code sharing"
1,40,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:09,"F-OD, F-M, F-ETU",".I guess all of the data sharing I've done so far has been on osf.io. That website. I know that there are other websites that can be used, and I'm kind of not sure what...There are many options, and so I think I just kind of chose this one because it was free and easy to use."
1,42,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:13,KOP-OD,"But I know that from my own field there's also open neuro, I think, has data sharing, and I haven't used that ye"
1,42,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:08,PE-OD,"So, I'd say most of my open science practices would be related to code sharing and data sharing so either on...I guess all of the data sharing I've done so far has been on osf.io. That website. I know that there are other websites that can be used, and I'm kind of not sure what...There are many options, and so I think I just kind of chose this one because it was free and easy to use. But I know that from my own field there's also open neuro, I think, has data sharing, and I haven't used that yet"
2,5,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:14,PE-OM,"we also have a lab Github, where, even as we're doing our analyses, I have all of my students use Github to have version controlled code. Usually we don't work completely openly at the beginning. So we will have private repositories for code while we're working on them. And then, when we are ready to submit our paper, we will make the publication ready one that can be reviewed. So, I know that some people do fully open as they're going, but we tend to, you know, have our sort of in-house version of the code and then our camera-ready version when we're happy with it. We put that as the public one that's released with the paper, or released during the review."
2,9,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:20,"B-OM, B-KOP","The only problem I've had with that is recently I submitted to a conference where they required double blind review. And then it's kind of not possible to ha...I don't know how to do the double-blind code because there was no way to upload it, so we just didn't include it. But I felt like that was kind of a missed opportunity. So, if people know and have dealt with that, I'd love to hear that."
2,16,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:25,KOP-OM,"We were also asked to share our codes and our our experimental paradigms that have to be reviewed double in a double-blind fashion, and there are ways on OSF. You can create a double blind link without seeing the uploaders’ ID. Github, it's impossible."
2,23,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:32,PE-SA,"So, I have a preprint of my Thesis Masters. So that's that's something that I did early on without really even knowing what open science was."
2,25,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:37,PE-OD,"And then during my doctorate, so I first published on data that was collected before I was there, and we did have someone reach out for the data. But it just never happened"
2,27,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:38,"PE-PR, B-PR, B-T","I know that we tried to publish like, trying to put something and register some...a couple of manuscripts, but it didn't happen because it was taking away time from the actual manuscript"
2,32,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:42,U-OS,"I think part of the thing that we ran into is that all of us were learning how to do open science, including my PI. And there was a lot of hesitancy there of like, what do we need to do? What, what's good to put in? And then also just making sure that you're selecting the right area. So, like I do a lot in language and literacy and speech, and so like I know OSF is a good one, but I think there's a couple of new ones that have started that are specific more for that area."
2,34,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:45,"B-OD, B-CX","And then, like my dissertation data, I have it in my IRB that I can do it. But you know, life got in the way, and it just didn't happen, because it is something new, and it takes more effort. And I had to finish over that"
2,38,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:47,"PE-OM, B-OM, B-NE","And then, actually, in my Phd program, I learned how to use GitHub. But my PI didn't use R or anything like that. And so then it became more of like a niche for me, and no one used it, and so I haven't used it for a while. But I need to get back to it as I am starting to do a lot on my own."
2,39,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:50,LPE-OS,"So, I've had like sprinklings of it, but not a whole lot of like follow through, and success with it"
2,42,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:50,WTL-OS,"So, I've had like sprinklings of it, but not a whole lot of like follow through, and success with it so definitely an area I want to establish myself in, because I want this to happen. But I think I'm just like at the point where I'm I'm unsure, and we love support and resources to like guide me. Kind of like you're on the right track. Keep going! So that's where I'm at with it."
3,5,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:59,LPE-OS,So I also have like very limited experience with using like like open science
3,6,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:00,A-OA,the first is publish in open access journals. 
3,9,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 19:59,"B-OA, B-M","To me, there's like 2 parts: the first is publish in open access journals. So that's something, I think, as a very junior PI that's kind of a financial burdens a lot. So because, like where my PI has a lot of money. So I don't need to worry about that. But like for myself, that's something I think will be something I need to consider seriously when I’m thinking about which journal to submit to"
3,10,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:00,A-OD,I think it's just sharing the data
3,11,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:01,PE-OM,sharing also the experiment paradigm
3,11,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:01,PE-OD," I think it's just sharing the data, sharing the XX. I only recently try to kind of sharing my data for one of my recent papers...sharing the data and sharing also the experiment paradigm."
3,16,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:08,"B-OD, B-SL","But for some of the platforms, they don't give you that amount of storage limit. Which is kind of a limit for some of them. So that's something I can...as I'm learning the process. I feel like I'm still trying to figure out which would be a good platform kind of, for sharing the data"
3,23,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:13,"TE-W, TE-SA, R-UCSD"," I was gonna say that I had attended one of the CSDisseminate workshops a couple of years ago that talked about how to figure out which version of your papers you're legally allowed to share, and I thought that was really helpful"
3,26,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:16,I-SA,And then never quite got to the point of getting everything posted on my website. But...on my lab website. But it's something that's on my To Do List
3,26,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:15,PE-SA, And spent some time kind of going through my publications and figuring that out. And then never quite got to the point of getting everything posted on my website. But...on my lab website. But it's something that's on my To Do List.
3,29,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:20,B-KJP,And like figuring out the different things for different journals.
3,30,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:17,"B-SA, B-T","It's just been something that's been pushed to the bottom of the To Do List for kind of a long time, because it's really time consuming to go through all of those old papers and figure out, where is that final version of the accepted manuscript? And like figuring out the different things for different journals. So it's really just been sort of a time limitation that's kind of prevented me from following through on doing that at this point, even though I'd like to."
3,33,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:19,"PE-OA, PE-NIH","Many of my papers are also one PubMed Central, because they were affiliated with an NIH-funded study. So I feel like I personally have a better understanding of of that of the publication open science possibilities."
3,34,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:22,LPE-OD,"And I I haven't a lot of the data sharing kinds of things that others have talked about, and so that that feels to me more overwhelming at the moment "
3,36,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:22,KOP-NIH,in terms of knowing what to do and looking at the new NIH Grant requirements. There's a new like data sharing plan form that's much more in depth in talking about like repositories and things like that
3,37,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:23,U-OD,I don't even know where sort of to begin with that at this point.
3,39,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:24,WTL-OD,I have to do some work in the next couple of months before my next submission to figure out exactly what is meant...I'm meant to do with that. So...motivated to learn.
3,40,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:24,"B-OD, B-T",But I I do feel like there's a big learning curve and time commitment associated with figuring it all out.
4,6,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:27,"TE-OM, TE-PhD, TE-NE","I guess my only formal one was in my stats courses that we used Github, but otherwise I haven't had any formal education about that."
4,13,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:31,"TE-W, TE-OM, TE-OS","But I have been involved in a summer workshop called Neuro Academy, which is at the University of Washington. And they, it's very much about open science practices and the open Science community, and particularly code replicability and science replicability. And so I have been an instructor there. And so I've watched other people give talks, and that's actually helped me learn as well, even though I was not formally a student. But that's a great group"
4,20,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:37,TE-OR," I mainly follow the openly accessible training materials by the Society for Neuroscience, and also there are open, open science framework. They have a lot of materials, such we can comb through about how to how to do open science."
4,21,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:38,TE-V,"There are a lot of Youtube videos as well, and have a bookmark folder for those resources, and happy to share"
4,24,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:43,TE-NE,"I did not receive any formal training in my doctoral program, my postdoc, or even on boarding as a new faculty member at my home institution."
4,27,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:43,"B-OS, B-T, B-TE","And so I've been finding that in order to learn more, it requires a lot of self study, and then, of course, finding the time and the bandwidth to move that item up on the priority list is always so challenging, although I really value it so it's it's been a bit of a struggle personally."
4,41,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:48,U-OD,That's how accessible it is to the users in terms of uploading and downloading data. And so what what would be the most straightforward way to do it. I'm constant today at a loss.
4,43,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:46,"B-OD, B-ID","We have multi-modal data, including for example, video, audiom speech sample, that can be identifiable. They're They're just lot of issues that we need to deal with before uploading and the deidentifying to the best we can for data sharing."
4,44,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:44,WTL-OD," I'm still very interested in knowing what's the best way to share data. There are multiple platforms online, including open neuro and a few other...I’m blanking on the name  I can look it up and you put it on the chat. That's how accessible it is to the users in terms of uploading and downloading data. And so what what would be the most straightforward way to do it. I'm constant today at a loss. We have multi-modal data, including for example, video, audiom speech sample, that can be identifiable. They're They're just lot of issues that we need to deal with before uploading and the deidentifying to the best we can for data sharing. So I I think it requires more professional support than just self-training."
5,6,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:50,U-OD,"And going along with that, at what point you know, are you able to share your data like how much cleaning needs to happen. Besides deidentification. So like for example, I use Redcap. And so a lot of it comes down, and it's like this, and then a subhead, depending on what type of question you're asking. And I can just give a key with that? Or do I have to convert that because I do that when I'm running my scripts in R"
5,7,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:50,WTL-OD,"But, so just understanding more about how much do you have to prepare your data. What's expected in that?"
5,8,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:51,WTL-PR,I would love to to learn more about pre-registration
5,11,Micah Hirsch,9/5/2023 23:10,U-OS,"and then kind of thinking about also, if like I do...If I write them in... like I'm writing up my dissertation. Do like a preprint, or are there other options that are more efficient and effective because I do need to move it along. So just thinking more about those aspects."
5,17,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:53,WTL-OPR,"I'd be curious to know more about open peer review. I don't know that I i'm familiar with that term, and it just sort of struck me as interesting. So that's my two cents."
5,22,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:57,"B-OA, B-M","I guess all of these sound interesting, but the a lot of people have mentioned the financial burden of open access, so the gold open access."
5,23,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:57,KOP-SA,I know that I could preprint a study
5,25,Micah Hirsch,9/1/2023 20:57,"U-OA, WTL-OA","I don't know, like are there ways to get gold open access paid for if you don't have grant support for a particular project? That's what I would like to know."
5,35,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:35,"LP-Web, LP-A",It would be really helpful to kind of do something where we can see information online.
5,37,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:38,LP-WG,"But then have a space to come to where we're working through something and we're stuck. So maybe it's, you know. Maybe you have a project that you're working on from the ground up."
5,38,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:37,"LP-V, LP-I","But I think, having the ability to do like pre-recorded stuff, or maybe interactive."
5,41,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:39,"LP-HA, LP-WG, LP-I, LP-A","But you can go back and look at it, and then have spaces to work on something and kind of like hold me accountable to coming back to it, and then also have questions and get those answers that are more specific to my type of data."
5,42,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:40,LP-SD,and then also have questions and get those answers that are more specific to my type of data. Everybody has different data. And so there there can be different types of challenges.
6,8,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:42,LP-WG,"Maybe ongoing? So maybe it could be like 3-months...you could do like offerings of like 3 months, and you can apply to be in a cohort or something that can help. I find going longer than 3 months doesn't really happen, because you just get burnt out. But that would just, you know it could possibly be something over the summer or yeah, just different points, but that that could be something helpful to me."
6,14,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:43,"LP-S, LP-A","Probably we don't have time to attend like a long like workshop thing, but it's always there some resource there we can revert to."
6,15,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:43,LP-V,"Prerecorded, YouTube video, that would be helpful."
6,15,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:43,LP-H,Handout
6,16,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:44,"LP-I, LP-W","Sometimes, if maybe we have our students. They can attend some workshops and to have some interaction more like direct interaction. "
6,29,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:44,LP-PC,"Also, I wish there was like a like a hotline like like 1-800-help me with open science stuff."
6,30,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:45,"LP-A, B-T","So as the need like...I would love to say I would attend a webinar. But the honest truth is, I likely don't have the time to figure out how to make that work."
6,32,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:46,"LP-Web, LP-A","But when the need pops up, and it's like really urgent, and in the moment, if I could go to like an FAQ site, or like, just have that resource at my fingertips"
6,33,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:46,LP-PC,"like a open science coach that you could call or pop into, even, you know, asynchronously. That would be really, I think super helpful."
7,9,Danika Pfeiffer,10/6/2023 19:39,"LP-C, LP-SD","What I would love actually is. So you know their FAQ sections. What if there was like a open science triage quiz, or something where you're online and it's like, what type of data do  you have behavioral data, video data, HIPAA sensitive data ,like you have some flowchart where then it directs you to the appropriate resources based on what you're trying to do like that would be super nice. I don't know if that exists. But I would want that."
7,21,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:49,"B-PR, B-LOB","I guess. To me, I mean this isn't a direct answer to this question, but I'm not really sure what the benefits are of preregistering my study. So I think I I need to have a better understanding of why it's beneficial to do that before putting the time into figuring out how to do that."
7,26,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:51,B-T,"I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower."
7,28,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:52,B-R,"Time and and manpower. You know a lot of us have students, but it takes a while to get them trained. And this seems like something that would require some training from the PI if a student was going to assist with it."
7,30,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:53,B-LOB,"But yeah, I I I would. I would agree with X that if you don't necessarily see the benefit, then why why, invest the time in doing this. "
7,30,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:51,B-PR,"I I think, like with so much of getting your research program up and running as a junior investigator is just time. Time and and manpower. You know a lot of us have students, but it takes a while to get them trained. And this seems like something that would require some training from the PI if a student was going to assist with it. But yeah, I I I would. I would agree with X that if you don't necessarily see the benefit, then why why, invest the time in doing this. That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment."
7,30,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:53,"B-T, B-R","That that's what I would see would be the barriers, the manpower and the time investment."
7,39,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:55,"F-PR, F-B","No, well the thing is, the thing is, what is the benefit? The benefit is that you get stuff published no matter what the outcomes are. I think that’s XXXX. "
7,44,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:56,LPE-PR,"So I am, I'm very much in favor of preregistration. I haven’t done it myself yet."
7,44,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 16:57,I-PR,But I intend to.
8,6,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:03,"F-PR, F-B",I I can mention a benefit which is training students to think about design of the experiment in advance and to literature review to support their hypotheses. So I I use that as an opportunity to train my students how to write.
8,14,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:05,"F-PR, F-P",I think it's the existing template that is very handy for people who are new to preregistration and look for the kind of information necessary for a preregistered report. 
8,16,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:06,F-JS,And also the encouragement for registered reports in a by by different journals. So who can publish a register report without results? But it has to be a timely publication. It cannot be too long.
8,29,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:06,"B-SA, B-T, B-KJP","Well, I kind of mentioned this earlier, but I, to me the biggest barrier is time especially going backwards. Both the time to figure out which version, if for each article or each journal is legally allowed to be shared, and then finding that version and posting it somewhere, and that is not a small time investment in that. So that's been, to me, the biggest barrier."
8,35,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:07,"B-SA, B-I","I would say IT support to get everything up on our University affiliated website. So making sure like, because I can't post directly to my my like University website. It has to go through our IT team. So that's sometimes super efficient. And other times really not."
8,41,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:08,"B-SA, B-KJP","For me, understanding what are the things that I need to legally look out for, and just kind of making sure that it's all good before I do it. So that's kind of where I’m at."
8,44,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:09,MUR,We usually just use stored copies on on Research Gate and these websites. So you can post a link to that.
9,3,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:09,MUR,"But I’ve always shared everything wherever, whenever people request it. No matter what."
9,7,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:10,"B-I, B-SA","Well, the only barrier is what what what the University's policy is."
9,8,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:10,MUR,"But if somebody sends you a PM on the Research Gate or whatever, you can share whatever you want."
9,15,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:12,"F-SA, F-IS","So for us, X, I'm sorry to hear that you can't access your own website. So now I'm really happy that I can. So my university does allow us to change our own, you know X affiliated website, and my research assistant can do it. So that's great. I think all universities should do that."
9,18,Danika Pfeiffer,9/22/2023 21:07,"R-UCSD, F-SA, F-TE, TE-W","The the CSDisseminate workshop which I I went to, I think it was about 2 years ago, was extremely helpful in this,"
9,24,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:15,"F-CR, F-SA","because it directed, and I can't remember the names of the websites off the top of my head, but I do have them written down. So there's like websites where you can go to and search the journal and figure out for that journal which version of your manuscript you're legally allowed to share, and the rules kind of associated with that. But it's also, it's like in a couple of different places you have to go look. Not everything is all in the same spot. So it's not always just like a super streamlined process, but just knowing those resources, and where to look for that information was really really helpful."
9,30,Danika Pfeiffer,10/6/2023 19:39,"F-SA, F-JS","Maybe if the journal just once it was accepted, if they just, you know, send you an additional email with the PDF saying, here is the one that you can, self-archive. That seems like it would save time, for a lot of people"
9,42,Austin Thompson,8/31/2023 17:17,"F-OS, F-WG","I think maybe finding people at my university, too, that like finding the people that want to do open science or are doing it successfully, may be helpful, because every university is so different, just even website accessibility. Thankfully, I can do it. But I think just having people with you at your university could be helpful. So like finding that cohort. It's not always explicit or clear who does this so. Or who is working towards it. So."
10,7,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:12,"B-OA, B-M, IE-OA","Certainly the cost. I think that's the obvious answer, but especially the cost for junior investigators who might not have big you know, externally funded grants as we're building our program of research. And so some of the some of the smaller internal and external grants that are awarded early in your career just simply don't have the the budget to support that line item."
10,13,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:16,B-WR,"so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much.."
10,13,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:14,PE-OA,"I know somebody who recently had an article accepted to nature neuroscience, and their open access fee is $13,000. And so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much...They didn't pay it."
10,13,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:16,"B-OA, B-M","I agree, and they're also vastly different by journal. The amount of money that it is. I know somebody who recently had an article accepted to nature neuroscience, and their open access fee is $13,000. And so why would I pay that versus paying for a graduate student, or like part of a research assistant? It's crazy to me like I would love to support open access, but that is, I think, that's way too much...They didn't pay it."
10,17,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:17,"B-OA, B-M",It’s just you have to figure in the amount of money beforehand.
10,19,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:19,"F-OA, F-M, F-IS","And I hope that some of the resources will, I mean, many universities are working to supporting open access fees because they are basically stating on the on the...what’s it called? Library costs."
10,25,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:19,"F-OA, F-M",Same thing money.
10,27,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:20,F-M,I think definitely money.
10,33,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:20,F-OA,"I think definitely money. But you know department chairs or deans really valuing, having this open access to your work, and so having that support that can kind of come from the top. So even if you don't have the grant funds to pay for it, maybe somebody in administration really sees the value for your career and for the institution. I know that I think I think I had...I think we paid for open access for one of my articles, and it came from our department's budget, because my chair was just very supportive and just wanted, really valued me being able to have this as part of my publishing record."

If I understand that email correctly, it was from just a couple of months ago. X, if you have missed that email, we can read that email together."
11,1,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:29,"F-OA, F-IS",University support.
11,12,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:31,"B-OD, B-C, B-LOB","I think one of the barriers is is the value of the data set. I always feel that there is more in it than this. Just this one publication. So I'm, for for those reasons I'm reluctant to sharing, because I always think like there's like two more publications in this data set. So why would I give that away?"
11,21,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:33,"B-OD, B-FR","So for me, I guess it's one of the things is like how to format the data, and also format the protocol in a kind of accessible way to others. I know like different labs do different things. So how to format in a way that everyone can understand. I think that's..sounds like takes a little bit of effort. It's really like when we writing code. Sometimes we understand our code, but not necessarily others understand our code. So, there's something, maybe, to learn about how to make more accessible."
11,28,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:39,"B-OD, B-CX","I actually think that that this is starting to be a discussion, though I'm sorry. But I actually think this accessibility might be be useful as a barrier. So only people who are really dedicated will will work on it. It’s accessible to everyone. But it's not  that that just everyone can just pick it up and do something with it."
11,37,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:40,B-FR,I was talking about just like how to format it.
11,42,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:43,B-DI,"I use R and then I can get like a print out of what all the codes mean and everything. But then it's also trying to make sure that everybody understands the...

They may say, oh, there's a limitation in this data but it's like, well, that wasn't a focus. The focus was here. So I think there's just making sure interpretation of the data is done properly. And so how can I do that?"
11,43,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:44,"B-T, B-CX","But also make it less time and effortful, effortless? "

12,6,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:46,B-T,That's the the description of your whole experimental design takes time.
12,7,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:46,B-DI,You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata.
12,7,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:47,B-T,You you don't want people to misunderstand what the data was for. So there there need to be metadata. That's you. You spend time to create and clarify. 
12,8,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:49,B-FR,I think the amount ofalso related to formatting as well.
12,9,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:49,"B-T, B-R","The the amount of work that you put into this need also to be supported by resources. It's time, and it."

12,22,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:51,B-CR,"One quick one. Copyright of stimuli. So, I use stimuli that I'm really interested in natural speech perception. And so, we actually use some movie clip stimuli that are copyrighted. I think, under fair use it's fine to use them, but I can't share. I'm pretty sure that I can't share the stimuli online, but that would be super important for anybody who wants to use the raw data instead of just derived data that I've created."
12,23,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:52,U-OD,I'm honestly not sure what I should do about that.

12,36,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:56,"F-OD, F-CS, F-IS","you need to have supportive individuals, and there's an and and I think people in my department are very supportive of it. It's just no one's really done it. So I think there's that aspect just getting that support which I know has been said. But yeah, so for me, that's where I'm at, and probably getting some support and kind of like leading me through, it would be helpful."
12,42,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 14:58,"F-OD, F-E","I think it's like a culture issue. So, if it were the culture of the department in which you're working where this is just something that is standard practice. Then it might, I might be more likely to devote the time and energy to do it rather than trying to, you know. Find it within, you know, as a as working in a silo in just my research lab with my students and my research assistants."
13,5,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:07,"F-NIH, KOP-NIH","I think one thing that could be a facilitator, or at least forcing people to do. Is like, I said, the NIH grants have requirements, updated requirements now for, like a very detailed plan about how you are gonna share your data. So, thinking through that ahead of time, like forcing you to think you through that ahead of time and come up with plan that you document and put in with grant applications, I would think, would likely be a facilitator."
13,10,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:07,"F-E, F-B","I think that the other thing, though, is it's not really people in our positions, in tenure track jobs, we don't get credit anywhere in like the tenure process for using open science practices, well versus not using them. And it is extra time and effort to do. So, I think you know one other thing is like if this was valued by institutions more, if this was something where you got, I don't know it's recognized in some way, or it was prioritized by institutions, that that would also, I think, motivate people to do this more."

13,23,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:08,IOS-LS,"So many of the study, you see, is very small simple size. So I'm wondering if there is open data everywhere, so someone can put them together. Maybe create like a larger data, a database, so that I can maybe help answer some of the questions I can't answer. I think there's something there. Sometimes I will frustrated. I can only get like 10 people for my study, and everyone's doing such things. So which may be okay, if some scenario but I don't for science. But so maybe that's not the best way to do this. So I think that will be very beneficial from that perspective."
13,28,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:09,"IOS-IC, IOS-A","I think open science practice also increase the impact of our research, and to make it accessible to clinicians and the community."
13,29,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:10,IOS-TR,If we are able to keep our research as transparent as possible through open access journals.
13,35,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:10,IOS-RR,"I think it'll make the research more reproducible as well, because, even though it takes time, if people are encouraged either through positive or negative reinforcement to to do this, then, you know, if their data is formatted in a certain way, and they know how it's formatted. Then probably that code is gonna be more reproducible because you really had to think about presenting it to another audience to look at and use."
13,40,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:11,CI-FC,"I think it also gets us out of as researchers. It gets us out of our silos. So it allows us to be more collaborative, which is very important, and it allows for also more interdisciplinary practices to happen as well. So, and I think it's just it's it's demonstrating your willingness to work with others, and that you care. And that you're willing to grow and change as well."
13,41,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:12,"E-OS, I-OS","So, this is what I did now. Can't wait to do more in the future, hopefully, even better."
14,5,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:15,CI-FC,I think building community is a big one. The Neuro Academy workshop that I was involved in. I've met other people through that. 
14,6,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:15,CI-R,And then I've had invitations to give talks through that. So that's actually been a positive outcome of working with that community.
14,12,Danika Pfeiffer,8/31/2023 15:22,IOS-D,"I don't know. I actually actually wonder what effect does it have if other people publish something using your data set that they got through open science. What is the impact of it?<P>And I I don't know. I really don't know. Is it is going to positively affect your tenure evaluation, or is it just a publication for somebody else who mentions you in the acknowledgments? I have no idea."
14,14,Danika Pfeiffer,10/6/2023 19:37,IOS-Tr,"To hit back back to the first question, the the previous question. For the field, I'm I'm I'm hoping that it will change focus of the field more onto like like truth-seeking versus career management. If that makes sense. But that’s a difficult one."
